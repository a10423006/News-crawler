Everything you need to know about the controversial rise and fall of Katie Hill,2019-10-28,Politics,"After she won reelection last year as part of a historic, female-driven wave for House Democrats, the party picked Rep. Katie Hill (Calif.) to be one of its faces of success.She is young (32), diverse (one of the first openly bisexual members of Congress), politically astute (her first time running for office was for this seat) and from the kind of district that helped the Democrats win back the House last year and that they hope to keep.But as swift as her rise came her fall. Hill is resigning after less than a year in Congress over allegations she had relationships with staffers. Such relationships violate new House rules passed in the #MeToo era, making her seat potentially more competitive for Republicans. Here’s what happened, from the beginning.What happened: Hill has acknowledged having a consensual relationship with a campaign staffer but has denied having a relationship with a staffer in her D.C. office. She is resigning after her colleagues launched an ethics investigation into the claims, which were first seen on the conservative website RedState. It’s not immediately clear when she will resign.Why is she resigning if she is denying some of the accusations? Good question. She denies the more serious claim, that she had a relationship with a congressional staffer. (“Absolutely false,” she said in a statement last week.) It’s more serious because it would break new rules passed last year by the House after the #MeToo movement brought down nine members of Congress. As The Post’s Michelle Ye Hee Lee reports, “It is against the official code of conduct for members to ‘engage in a sexual relationship with any employee’ who works for the member.”Hill has been somewhat vague about why she is leaving. “I believe it is the best thing for my constituents, my community, and our country” to resign, she said in a statement Sunday. But she has also framed herself as a victim of revenge porn. Sexual photos of her with her campaign staffer were released online, and she has accused her husband, whom she is in the process of divorcing, of behind it. She said in her resignation statement that she is pursuing legal options.“I am saddened that the deeply personal matter of my divorce has been brought into public view and the vindictive claims of my ex have now involved the lives and reputations of unrelated parties,” she said.There’s some irony — and controversy — to Hill being the first one to lose her seat to these rules: The rules changes were driven by Democrats (though they passed a Republican-led Congress with lots of Republican support and leadership). And they were primarily in response to men leveraging their power for sex. The decades-old rules changes came after these events, as I reported last year:To supporters of Hill, or supporters of just having more female members in Congress, it seems unfair. Hill has not been accused of any wrongdoing — an ethics investigation was just getting started. And she was not accused of sexual harassment.“For decades, male lawmakers got away with those sort of shenanigans,” Los Angeles Times columnist Robin Abcarian wrote under the headline: “Katie Hill messed up but she should not have resigned.” “Wouldn’t you know it, the first one to fall afoul of the rule is a woman, and a bisexual woman, at that.”There’s also a political irony: During the 2018 campaign, political analysts called Hill “one of the most impressive Democratic contenders of 2018,” and Democratic strategists routinely talked up Hill to reporters as one of their best recruits.Her first time running for office, she beat a Republican, Steve Knight, in her home district outside Los Angeles, and she quickly became an ally to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). She was installed in a powerful position on one of the committees now involved in impeachment proceedings against President Trump, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Now, Pelosi has indicated it was right for her to resign — even before an ethics investigation in Congress concluded. Hill “came to Congress with a powerful commitment to her community and a bright vision for the future, and has made a great contribution as a leader of the Freshman Class,” Pelosi said in a statement. “She has acknowledged errors in judgment that made her continued service as a Member untenable. We must ensure a climate of integrity and dignity in the Congress, and in all workplaces.”It’s not immediately clear how competitive this seat becomes with Hill out: Before the allegations, the nonpartisan handicappers at Cook Political Report ranked her district as evenly split between Republican and Democratic voters, with a slight edge to Hill. The area has been trending Democratic and voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. The Los Angeles Times reports it’s unclear when a special election for her replacement will take place, largely because it is not clear when Hill will leave.Democrats will be trying to hang onto the 40 seats they won last year, a number of them in districts that also voted for Trump in 2016.",everything need know controversial rise fall katie hill reelection last year part historic female-driven wave house democrat party picked rep katie hill calif one face success young diverse one first openly bisexual member congress politically astute first time running office wa seat kind district helped democrat win back house last year hope keep swift rise came fall hill resigning le year congress allegation relationship staffer relationship violate new house rule passed # metoo era making seat potentially competitive republican ’ happened beginning happened hill ha acknowledged consensual relationship campaign staffer ha denied relationship staffer c office resigning colleague launched ethic investigation claim first seen conservative website redstate ’ immediately clear resign resigning denying accusation good question denies serious claim relationship congressional staffer “ absolutely false ” said statement last week ’ serious would break new rule passed last year house # metoo movement brought nine member congress post ’ michelle ye hee lee report “ official code conduct member ‘ engage sexual relationship employee ’ work member ” hill ha somewhat vague leaving “ believe best thing constituent community country ” resign said statement sunday ha also framed victim revenge porn sexual photo campaign staffer released online ha accused husband process divorcing behind said resignation statement pursuing legal option “ saddened deeply personal matter divorce ha brought public view vindictive claim ex involved life reputation unrelated party ” said ’ irony controversy hill first one lose seat rule rule change driven democrat though passed republican-led congress lot republican support leadership primarily response men leveraging power sex decades-old rule change came event reported last year supporter hill supporter female member congress seems unfair hill ha accused wrongdoing ethic investigation wa getting started wa accused sexual harassment “ decade male lawmaker got away sort shenanigan ” los angeles time columnist robin abcarian wrote headline “ katie hill messed resigned ” “ ’ know first one fall afoul rule woman bisexual woman ” ’ also political irony campaign political analyst called hill “ one impressive democratic contender ” democratic strategist routinely talked hill reporter one best recruit first time running office beat republican steve knight home district outside los angeles quickly became ally house speaker nancy pelosi d-calif wa installed powerful position one committee involved impeachment proceeding president trump house oversight government reform committee pelosi ha indicated wa right resign even ethic investigation congress concluded hill “ came congress powerful commitment community bright vision future ha made great contribution leader freshman class ” pelosi said statement “ ha acknowledged error judgment made continued service member untenable must ensure climate integrity dignity congress workplace ” ’ immediately clear competitive seat becomes hill allegation nonpartisan handicapper cook political report ranked district evenly split republican democratic voter slight edge hill area ha trending democratic voted hillary clinton los angeles time report ’ unclear special election replacement take place largely clear hill leave democrat trying hang onto seat last year number district also voted trump ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/everything-you-need-know-about-controversial-rise-fall-katie-hill/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
Why Trump may not see a sustained political boost from Baghdadi’s death,2019-10-28,Politics,"Over the span of about 12 hours on Sunday, President Trump experienced a remarkable high and a remarkable low. In the morning, he announced that U.S. forces had attacked the hideout of Islamic State founder and leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, resulting in Baghdadi’s death. After giving a statement to that effect, Trump engaged in a lengthy question-and-answer session with reporters, offering remarkable detail about the events leading up to the terrorist leader’s demise.Any hopes that the raid would lead to a new birth of affection for the continuously unpopular president, though, were dashed when he arrived at the World Series game in D.C. later that evening. After Trump was introduced to the crowd, the response was a chorus of boos.That’s hardly scientific, of course. The disapproval was from a crowd in predominantly Democratic D.C. that was already irritated at the score of an important game. But those hoping for a significant shift in views of Trump after the action against Baghdadi might nonetheless want to scale their expectations downward.We have a recent moment that seems as though it should provide some useful guidance on this question: the 2011 raid that resulted in the death of 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden. President Barack Obama’s approval rating rose seven points over the course of a week, driven in part by an 11-point jump among Republicans.But it was short-lived, a brief shift in a steady downward trend. Within two months, Obama’s approval overall and with every partisan group was back where it had been before bin Laden’s death — or lower.Speaking to reporters on Sunday, Trump contrasted Baghdadi with bin Laden directly.“Osama bin Laden was very big,” Trump said, “but Osama bin Laden became big with the World Trade Center.” By contrast, Baghdadi was “a man who built a whole, as he would like to call it, ‘a country,’ a caliphate, and was trying to do it again.”It’s unsurprising that Trump would amplify the importance of the terrorist neutralized on his watch relative to the one targeted by Obama. But it’s likely that most Americans are far more familiar with bin Laden than with Baghdadi. There doesn’t appear to be polling on this point, in part because a search of the Roper Center’s database of polls doesn’t include any that mention Baghdadi’s name. (There are more than 500 polls that mention bin Laden.)A look at Google search interest over the past year shows that bin Laden regularly accrued far more queries than did Baghdadi, although the Islamic State was generally (though not always) more searched than the dead al-Qaeda leader.By the time of bin Laden’s death, al-Qaeda had largely faded as a perceived threat in the eyes of Americans. The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks were 10 years in the past and, while the terrorist group continued to target Americans in the Middle East, it had failed to strike in Europe and the United States for several years. Bin Laden’s death was more symbolic, offering closure to the 9/11 attacks, than operationally debilitating.The fate of the Islamic State is more uncertain. The distributed nature of the organization has meant more sporadic attacks over time, including ones in Canada and France last year. Trump’s decision to allow Turkey to move into northeastern Syria has raised concerns about imprisoned Islamic State fighters being released; some already have been. The caliphate has been eradicated, but fighters remain in the region.The organization’s reach has been weakened by the hobbling of its communications arm. Baghdadi’s death may similarly decrease its ability to entice new adherents who might pose a direct threat to the United States. This uncertainty about the group’s abilities serves as a reminder that the Islamic State might still have the resources to strike in the United States — which would certainly shift perceptions of Baghdadi’s death.After bin Laden’s death, Obama gave a brief statement and didn’t take questions. Trump, on the other hand, engaged in an extended back-and-forth, during which he introduced all sorts of claims and details that both raised questions and inspired additional reporting.What could have been a simple announcement — this terrorist is now dead — became something more sprawling. Trump gave people a lot to think and to talk about when, in this case, having them focus on Baghdadi’s death might have been the most politically useful approach.The most practical reason to think that Trump may not see a sustained polling bump from the Baghdadi death is that, despite all of the remarkable events that have occurred during his presidency, his approval rating has remained remarkably consistent. Republicans love Trump, Democrats dislike him, and independents are skeptical. This new event seems unlikely to shift that calculus.It’s worth noting that polling suggests terrorism is generally a bigger concern for Republicans than for Democrats. Meaning that the death of a prominent terrorist seems like it would be more likely to prompt a boost with Republicans — the group with which Trump is already doing the best.We have certainly been surprised before on how the public reacts to news events, of course. But the idea that Trump will not suddenly become broadly popular thanks to this raid seems like a safe bet — World Series reaction aside.",trump may see sustained political boost baghdadi ’ death span hour sunday president trump experienced remarkable high remarkable low morning announced u force attacked hideout islamic state founder leader abu bakr al-baghdadi resulting baghdadi ’ death giving statement effect trump engaged lengthy question-and-answer session reporter offering remarkable detail event leading terrorist leader ’ demise hope raid would lead new birth affection continuously unpopular president though dashed arrived world series game c later evening trump wa introduced crowd response wa chorus boo ’ hardly scientific course disapproval wa crowd predominantly democratic c wa already irritated score important game hoping significant shift view trump action baghdadi might nonetheless want scale expectation downward recent moment seems though provide useful guidance question raid resulted death mastermind osama bin laden president barack obama ’ approval rating rose seven point course week driven part -point jump among republican wa short-lived brief shift steady downward trend within two month obama ’ approval overall every partisan group wa back bin laden ’ death lower speaking reporter sunday trump contrasted baghdadi bin laden directly “ osama bin laden wa big ” trump said “ osama bin laden became big world trade center ” contrast baghdadi wa “ man built whole would like call ‘ country ’ caliphate wa trying ” ’ unsurprising trump would amplify importance terrorist neutralized watch relative one targeted obama ’ likely american far familiar bin laden baghdadi ’ appear polling point part search roper center ’ database poll ’ include mention baghdadi ’ name poll mention bin laden look google search interest past year show bin laden regularly accrued far query baghdadi although islamic state wa generally though always searched dead al-qaeda leader time bin laden ’ death al-qaeda largely faded perceived threat eye american sept attack year past terrorist group continued target american middle east failed strike europe united state several year bin laden ’ death wa symbolic offering closure attack operationally debilitating fate islamic state uncertain distributed nature organization ha meant sporadic attack time including one canada france last year trump ’ decision allow turkey move northeastern syria ha raised concern imprisoned islamic state fighter released already caliphate ha eradicated fighter remain region organization ’ reach ha weakened hobbling communication arm baghdadi ’ death may similarly decrease ability entice new adherent might pose direct threat united state uncertainty group ’ ability serf reminder islamic state might still resource strike united state would certainly shift perception baghdadi ’ death bin laden ’ death obama gave brief statement ’ take question trump hand engaged extended back-and-forth introduced sort claim detail raised question inspired additional reporting could simple announcement terrorist dead became something sprawling trump gave people lot think talk case focus baghdadi ’ death might politically useful approach practical reason think trump may see sustained polling bump baghdadi death despite remarkable event occurred presidency approval rating ha remained remarkably consistent republican love trump democrat dislike independent skeptical new event seems unlikely shift calculus ’ worth noting polling suggests terrorism generally bigger concern republican democrat meaning death prominent terrorist seems like would likely prompt boost republican group trump already best certainly surprised public reacts news event course idea trump suddenly become broadly popular thanks raid seems like safe bet world series reaction aside ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2019/10/28/why-trump-may-not-see-sustained-political-boost-baghdadis-death/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
The Technology 202: Facebook takes down false ad from political group. But it still won't police politicians directly.,2019-10-28,Politics,"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)Facebook removed an ad over the weekend that made false claims about Sen. Lindsey Graham. But the ad was run by a political action committee and not an individual politician, underlining the different standard for policing such content from the social media behemoth.Facebook took the action after the left-leaning group, The Really Online Lefty League, posted an ad last week to test Facebook’s ad policies. The ad falsely claimed the South Carolina Republican and fierce Trump defender supported the Green New Deal, a sweeping approach to climate change that failed in the Senate. Facebook spokesman Tom Channick told Reuters the ad was eligible for review — and potential removal — by the platform's third-party fact-checking partners because it was paid for by a political action group and not a politician. The ad was inspired by an exchange during Mark Zuckerberg’s Capitol Hill hearing Wednesday, when the Facebook CEO told Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) she could “probably” run an ad claiming Republicans support the Green New Deal during a heated line of questioning. Some critics said the erroneous ad highlighted the problems with Facebook's political ads policy. It also raises fresh questions about the company’s ability to detect and fight false information in ads ahead of the 2020 election because the PAC ad was initially approved by Facebook and ran on the platform.  Sleeping Giants, a group that has called on media outlets to remove advertising from outlets like Breitbart, said on Twitter:This is it. This is exactly why the @facebook political ad policy must be scrapped. To allow politicians to lie with impunity while collecting cash for the privilege is so incredibly dangerous. All it does is guarantee the death of truth and profitability of Facebook. https://t.co/ADLpMMMfeoDaniel Tunkelang, a tech consultant, questioned how Facebook had arrived at its policy:I'm sympathetic to the challenge of Facebook's balancing act as a neutral-ish platform, but I'm struggling to understand the decision process that led to fact-checking posts unless they're from politicians -- but not if they're from political groups. https://t.co/rlym5wMKVMFacebook's policies on political ads have been under fire since the company officially announced last month it would not submit ads or posts sponsored by politicians to its third-party fact checkers. 2020 Democratic presidential candidates have blasted the company for allowing President Trump to make false claims about former vice president Joe Biden in ads, and Rep. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) recently told the Technology 202 he's working on legislation to ensure that Facebook isn't making money off of politicians disseminating falsehoods. The Really Online Lefty League decided to run the ad to spark greater debate about how the social network should handle misinformation in ads. “It shouldn’t be up to one man or one company to decide for a country what truth in advertising in politics looks like,” Adriel Hampton, The Really Online Lefty League treasurer who made the video, told Newsweek. ""And we need to have a robust conversation around that, which includes where Mark Zuckerberg is not the decision-maker.""Hampton said the ad was approved by Faebook overnight with zero questions. The company has previously said it’s working to improve its systems to address phony ads after Russian actors were able to purchase Facebook ads to spread political disinformation during the 2016 election. ""It just shows you that not only is Facebook not enforcing any kind of truth in advertising, there's no tools for people to get it to the fact-checkers—that I can see—and people believe it,"" Hampton said in the same Newsweek interview. Hampton spliced together videos to make it appear as if President Trump’s ally was approving the Green New Deal. Graham’s office confirmed to Reuters that the congressman does not support Ocasio-Cortez’s initiative. David Roberts, a writer at Vox, said the ad raises new questions about a future where misinformation is shared more widely in videos. Though this ad did not appear to be a deepfake, he noted social media's misinformation challenges will only get worse as such videos doctored with artificial intelligence become more widely available:I guess this is kinda funny but also our future of deep fakes and unreality, where no one knows anything for sure and everyone falls back on tribe to find certainty, fills me with dread. https://t.co/0LKhP8DjNiIt seems that Facebook is set on treating third-party ads differently. My colleagues Tony Romm and Isaac Stanley-Becker reported this morning that Facebook took down some ads from a pro-Trump super PAC for violating its policies and submitted others to its third-party fact-checking partners. The ads sought personal information of voters by targeting them with messages that said their voter registration was incomplete. You are reading The Technology 202, our guide to the intersection of technology and politics.Not a regular subscriber?Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, left, and Robert Thomson, CEO of News Corp..(AP Photo/Mark Lennihan)BITS: Zuckerberg is furtehr struggling to defend Facebook's decision to include right-wing news source Breitbart in its new News Tab program, Adi Robertson at The Verge reports. Zuckerberg described the feature as “dedicated to high-quality and curated news,” in an interview with News Corp CEO Robert Thomson on Friday. When asked by the New York Times's Marc Tracy how Breitbart, a site known for fabricating stories and spreading racist views, fit the criteria, Zuckerberg responded:“Part of having this be a trusted source is that it needs to have a diversity of views in there, so I think you want to have content that represents different perspectives,” he said.Breitbart is not a paid partner and its inclusion doesn't guarantee that its content will be featured, Zuckerberg added. But his defense of Breitbart, which reporters and researchers have linked to white nationalism, drew swift criticism. The New York Times's Charlie Warzel opined that the incident highlighted Zuckerberg's emphasis on growth above all other principles. “His only consistent ideology is that connectivity is a universal good,” writes Warzel. “And his only consistent goal is advancing that ideology, at nearly any cost.”Adam Mosseri, head of Instagram, defended Zuckerberg. He said that while he was “not defending Breitbart,” he questioned if reporters criticizing Facebook “want a platform our scale to make decisions to exclude news organizations based on their ideology.”Two things to consider: (1) do you really want platform as big as Facebook embracing a political ideology? And (2) not as important, and this is an honest question, why such a different reaction to Breitbart being Apple News partner?The Guardian's Julia Carrie Wong called it a ""very good argument for breaking up Facebook.""Very strong argument for breaking up Facebook from architect of News Feed, current head of Instagram pic.twitter.com/n0KCrlFM3sThe Pentagon has awarded Microsoft a $10 billion cloud computing contract called JEDI, Friday, Oct. 25, 2019. The contentious bidding process for the contract pitted Microsoft, Amazon and Oracle, among others, against one another. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File)NIBBLES: The Pentagon awarded a $10 billion contract to upgrade its cloud computing services to Microsoft over competitor Amazon on Friday evening, my colleagues Aaron Gregg and Jay Greene report. Now, the president's role in lobbying against awarding the contract to Amazon — a potential violation of federal law — could become the subject of litigation, experts tell Aaron and Jay. The Department of Defense snubbed cloud-computing giant Amazon after an intense lobbying effort and lawsuit by rival Oracle that the contract was biased in favor of Amazon. Amazon had a bid in for the so-called JEDI contract in July, but the President ordered a halt to the process, publicly citing complaints from Amazon's competitors. Privately, Trump instructed Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to review the award because of concerns it would go to Amazon, officials told Aaron and Jay. Former Defense staffer Guy Snodgrass said that Trump also asked former defense secretary Jim Mattis to “screw” Amazon and lock it out of the bid process in 2018.The Defense Department maintained in a public statement that all companies, “were treated fairly and evaluated consistent with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria.” A person familiar with Amazon’s thinking said the company is “evaluating options” for protesting the decision, Aaron and Jay report.BYTES: Google is struggling with internal debate over its decision to hire a former Department of Homeland Security official who backed Trump's travel ban on Muslims, CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged in a recent all-hands meeting, my colleague Greg Bensinger reports. While Google has tried to quell internal political debate, its moderation efforts have sparked even more concerns from employees. “We are genuinely struggling with some issues — transparency at scale,” said Pichai in a video of the meeting obtained by The Washington Post. “I think we need to figure out how to make this work better so we can actually drive the open culture we have. That needs to come with some balance — you’ve clearly seen the amount of leaks we are seeing.”But employees, who have been increasingly public in their protests against the company's behavior and work with the government, weren't satisfied with the answer.“Are we supporting the border camps now?” asked an employee in another online question, referring to Miles Taylor, the former DHS employee, who's hiring was first reported by BuzzFeed. During the meeting, some employees accused Google leadership of censoring questions about Taylor. Karan Bhatia, a Google vice president for government affairs, defended Taylor’s hiring, saying his expertise is in counterterrorism and national security. Other employees expressed greater concerns with new content moderation software the company is rolling out to monitor meetings for 100 or more workers. The company wants to use the same software to eventually monitor internal forums.— News from the public sector:— News from the private sector:Trump had some more criticism for Apple CEO Tim Cook this

The Health 202: Officials confirm THC oil is linked to vaping deaths — but they can't regulate it for safety,2019-10-28,Politics,"THE PROGNOSISSanders speaks to supporters during a rally on Oct. 19 in New York. (AP Photo/Eduardo Munoz Alvarez)Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) is intensifying his calls to legalize marijuana products. That could help the federal government prevent more vaping-related deaths in the future.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed Friday what many had already suspected: That most people who died from a spate of vaping-related injuries used products containing illegal THC oil, the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana, my colleague Lena H. Sun reports.“Based on data available from 860 of the 1,604 patients who have fallen ill with the disease, about 85 percent reported using THC-containing products, compared to about 10 percent who reported exclusively vaping nicotine-containing products,” Lena writes. “Many sick patients said they bought THC vape products on the black market, and those have come under increased scrutiny.“The data do continue to point towards THC-containing products as the source of individuals’ injury,” said CDC principal deputy director Anne Schuchat. Officials don’t know what about the products are harmful, “but we’re seeing THC as a marker for products that are risky,” she said.As we wrote last month, illegal vape cartridges containing THC also contain significant amounts of vitamin E acetate. Because cannabis oil is expensive, producers use the acetate to dilute and thicken it without affecting its flavor or smell. But the vitamin’s oil-like properties are associated with the kinds of respiratory problems many patients have reported, including cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.Abraham Gutman, editorial writer for the Philadelphia Inquirer:CDC: “We've narrowed this clearly to THC-containing products that are associated with most patients who are experiencing lung injury”don’t say itdon’t say itdon’t say itdon’t say itdon’t say itdon’t say itdon’t say it📢WE TOLD YOU SO📢https://t.co/Svwqsz8aB0So if it’s THC oil at the root of the injuries – and not vaping itself – that raises questions about what regulators can do to make sure the compound is safe. And the answer is: Not much.While 11 states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana use to some degree and many more allow its medical use, marijuana and marijuana-derived products remain illegal federally. That means the Food and Drug Administration can’t exert oversight over even the riskiest marijuana products – or even evaluate claims made by the manufacturers selling devices for cannabis.The FDA is working with U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials at international mail facilities to trace the supply chain of potential illicit vaping products, Lena reports. But while THC remains illegal under federal law, the door is closed to federal agencies who might otherwise be able to evaluate how these compounds are manufactured and marketed.The result, former FDA commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote recently, is an “impasse.”“Federal agencies exert little oversight, and regulation is left to a patchwork of inadequate state agencies,” he wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal. “The weak state bodies sanction the adoption of unsafe practices such as vaping concentrates, while allowing an illegal market in cannabis to flourish.”“The recent lung injuries and deaths confirm the market has become a Wild West of potent and shadowy products,” he continued.Look at Washington State. The state has a regulated cannabis market and it requires that vape products sold in stores be checked for potency, toxins and residual solvents. But there’s little state regulators can do when it comes to black market vapes often found to contain “cutting agents” like the harmful vitamin E acetate.Dank, a shadowy but widely sold illegal marijuana vape, is drawing the attention of investigators looking into a rash of mysterious lung illnesses around the U.S.(Northwest Metro Drug Task Force/Minnesota Departments of Public Safety via AP)Marijuana legalization hasn’t occupied much time on the Democratic debate stages so far, perhaps because most of the candidates agree on it.But Sanders, who has long supported legalizing marijuana, is leaning into the issue on the campaign trail. He released a proposal last week to legalize pot and expunge criminal convictions related to the drug, my colleague Sean Sullivan reports.“Sanders’s plan, which aims to overhaul an approach he argues has unfairly hurt minorities, calls for using executive power to reclassify marijuana as a dangerous controlled substance and passing legislation to permanently legalize the drug,” Sean writes. “It would direct federal and state authorities to review, vacate and expunge past marijuana convictions.”Former vice president Joe Biden and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who are polling ahead of Sanders, have also proposed sweeping changes to the country’s marijuana laws. Their proposals are emblematic of a broader shift among both Democrat and Republican politicians favoring more tolerant drug laws instead of more toughness.Early on in the Trump administration, former attorney general Jeff Sessions signaled he would crack down on marijuana in a reversal from the Obama administration’s policy of turning a blind eye to states that had legalized it. But the administration ultimately changed little about its approach, and recently, President Trump didn’t rule out legalizing marijuana during his presidency.“We’re going to see what’s going on,” the president said in late August. “It’s a very big subject. And right now we’re allowing states to make that decision. And a lot of states are making that decision.”Meanwhile, the CDC is erring on the side of caution with its recommendations to the American public. Agency officials are continuing to recommend that people refrain from using all e-cigarettes even though most people who have fallen ill used products containing THC.You are reading The Health 202, our must-read newsletter on health policy.Not a regular subscriber?Demonstrators hold signs that read “We Vape! We Vote!” outside a rally with President Trump in Dallas. (Dylan Hollingsworth/Bloomberg)AHH: Trump’s campaign has been privately pushing the White House to walk back its proposed ban on flavored vaping products, warning that it could hamper the 2020 reelection efforts, our Post colleagues Michael Scherer, Josh Dawsey, Laurie McGinley and Neena Satija report. The president’s campaign manager Brad Parscale commissioned an internal campaign poll aimed at bolstering the idea Trump supporters who use e-cigarettes might waver on supporting Trump next year if the administration actually bans some products.“The political lobbying effort comes as the Trump administration is considering whether to continue allowing menthol- and mint-flavored e-cigarette products, according to three people familiar with the deliberations,” our colleagues write. “Allowing these sales would mark a major retreat from a proposed ban announced in September on 'all non-tobacco' flavors. Government data shows that nearly two-thirds of high schoolers who use ­e-cigarettes use mint or menthol flavors.”Anti-tobacco activists and health groups are angry about the possibility of the White House softening its initial proposal. “Excluding menthol would be huge — it means that kids will buy menthol,” said Desmond Jenson, an attorney with the Public Health Law Center at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St. Paul, Minn. “If you give them one flavor, that’s what they will buy. It doesn’t solve the problem.” Such a move could also be a boon to e-cigarette producers. Former FDA Gottlieb suggested tobacco companies Altria and Reynolds would benefit if mint and menthol e-cigarettes remain on the market.  Anti-abortion advocates gather outside the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis. (AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File)OOF: A hearing before a state commission starts this week to determine whether the last abortion clinic in Missouri will keep its license. The Administrative Hearing Commission will weigh arguments over the fate of the clinic after the federal judge referred the case to the commission over the summer. “The Missouri health department has said the Planned Parenthood clinic failed to correct all of the deficiencies it found during an annual inspection in the spring, emphasizing concerns over its compliance and patient safety,” the Wall Street Journal’s Jennifer Calfas reports.“In documents filed to the state commission, the attorney general’s office also argued against a constitutional right to abortion in the state. ‘The right to abortion is not deeply rooted in Missouri’s unique history and traditions,’ the response, signed by Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt, said.”But lawyers representing Planned Parenthood say the licensing battle is the latest in a serious of efforts by the state to limit abortion access. The state is currently one of six that have just one abortion clinic. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.). (AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)OUCH: Divisions within the Democratic Party on proposals to lower drug prices may hamper the effort altogether, especially as potential impeachment proceedings present a hurdle to any legislative efforts. Some progressives say House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) legislation to allow the federal government to negotiate some drug prices covered by Medicare and the private market doesn’t go far enough. They say the bill “falls short of full negotiation for all drugs in Medicare,” the Wall Street Journal’s Stephanie Armour reports. “The dissent means a full House floor vote won’t occur until November at the earliest.”That’s just in the House. In the Senate, there are disagreements over drug-pricing legislation in a bipartisan proposal from Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.). The bill, which in part would have drug companies reimburse Medicare if prices increase more than the inflation rate, “is seen as anti-free-market by some Senate Republicans,” Stephanie writes.The divisions in both chambers could mean the White House won’t get a win on drug pricing this year.A section of a burning fence is seen during the wind-driven Kincade Fire in Santa Rosa, Calif. (REUTERS/Stephen Lam)— As the Kincade Wildfire raged through some parts of Sonoma County in California, some farmworkers in regions not immediately threatened continued to work through the dangerous smoke and heat.  For those in wine country, this time of year is not just the peak of fire season in the state but the peak of grape harvest, Kaiser Health News’s Anna Maria Barry-Jester reports. That means some farmworkers are putting their health at risk in order to try to harvest hundreds of thousands of dollars’ worth of grapes.“As wildfires of this strength and intensity grow more frequent, so do concerns for field workers, who can face conditions that jeopardize their health, wages and housing,” Anna writes. “Outside of the fire itself, the main health concern in wildfire conditions is smoke, which produces particulate matter, a mix of gases and microscopic pieces of solid matter. The particles can penetrate deep into the lungs, increasing the risk of respiratory diseases and asthma, as well as heart problems.”— And here are a few more good reads: Coming Up",health official confirm thc oil linked vaping death regulate safety prognosissanders speaks supporter rally oct new york ap photo eduardo munoz alvarez sen bernie sander i-vt intensifying call legalize marijuana product could help federal government prevent vaping-related death future center disease control prevention confirmed friday many already suspected people died spate vaping-related injury used product containing illegal thc oil psychoactive ingredient marijuana colleague lena h sun report “ based data available patient fallen ill disease percent reported using thc-containing product compared percent reported exclusively vaping nicotine-containing product ” lena writes “ many sick patient said bought thc vape product black market come increased scrutiny “ data continue point towards thc-containing product source individual ’ injury ” said cdc principal deputy director anne schuchat official ’ know product harmful “ ’ seeing thc marker product risky ” said wrote last month illegal vape cartridge containing thc also contain significant amount vitamin e acetate cannabis oil expensive producer use acetate dilute thicken without affecting flavor smell vitamin ’ oil-like property associated kind respiratory problem many patient reported including cough shortness breath chest pain abraham gutman editorial writer philadelphia inquirer cdc “ narrowed clearly thc-containing product associated patient experiencing lung injury ” ’ say itdon ’ say itdon ’ say itdon ’ say itdon ’ say itdon ’ say itdon ’ say it📢we told so📢https co svwqszabso ’ thc oil root injury – vaping – raise question regulator make sure compound safe answer much state district columbia legalized marijuana use degree many allow medical use marijuana marijuana-derived product remain illegal federally mean food drug administration ’ exert oversight even riskiest marijuana product – even evaluate claim made manufacturer selling device cannabis fda working u custom border protection official international mail facility trace supply chain potential illicit vaping product lena report thc remains illegal federal law door closed federal agency might otherwise able evaluate compound manufactured marketed result former fda commissioner scott gottlieb wrote recently “ impasse ” “ federal agency exert little oversight regulation left patchwork inadequate state agency ” wrote op-ed wall street journal “ weak state body sanction adoption unsafe practice vaping concentrate allowing illegal market cannabis flourish ” “ recent lung injury death confirm market ha become wild west potent shadowy product ” continued look washington state state ha regulated cannabis market requires vape product sold store checked potency toxin residual solvent ’ little state regulator come black market vapes often found contain “ cutting agent ” like harmful vitamin e acetate dank shadowy widely sold illegal marijuana vape drawing attention investigator looking rash mysterious lung illness around u northwest metro drug task force minnesota department public safety via ap marijuana legalization ’ occupied much time democratic debate stage far perhaps candidate agree sander ha long supported legalizing marijuana leaning issue campaign trail released proposal last week legalize pot expunge criminal conviction related drug colleague sean sullivan report “ sander ’ plan aim overhaul approach argues ha unfairly hurt minority call using executive power reclassify marijuana dangerous controlled substance passing legislation permanently legalize drug ” sean writes “ would direct federal state authority review vacate expunge past marijuana conviction ” former vice president joe biden sen elizabeth warren d-mass polling ahead sander also proposed sweeping change country ’ marijuana law proposal emblematic broader shift among democrat republican politician favoring tolerant drug law instead toughness early trump administration former attorney general jeff session signaled would crack marijuana reversal obama administration ’ policy turning blind eye state legalized administration ultimately changed little approach recently president trump ’ rule legalizing marijuana presidency “ ’ going see ’ going ” president said late august “ ’ big subject right ’ allowing state make decision lot state making decision ” meanwhile cdc erring side caution recommendation american public agency official continuing recommend people refrain using e-cigarettes even though people fallen ill used product containing thc reading health must-read newsletter health policy regular subscriber demonstrator hold sign read “ vape !

E.U. pushes Brexit to end of January at British Prime Minister Johnson’s request,2019-10-28,World,"BRUSSELS — The European Union agreed Monday to delay Britain’s exit date from the bloc to Jan. 31, once again postponing Brexit and potentially paving the way for a British general election beforehand.The postponement came in response to a request from British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was forced to ask for more time after Parliament shot down his effort to speed the country out of the European Union by the previous deadline of Oct. 31. Johnson had said he would get Britain out of the bloc by then with or without a deal to buffer the economic turmoil expected to be set off by the departure. Parliament had different ideas, insisting on legal guarantees that Britain agree to a departure deal before exiting the European Union. It was the first of a string of legislative defeats for Johnson, who has been forced to go more slowly on Brexit than he had wanted.Europeans once hoped the British would reverse Brexit. Now, many can’t wait for them to leave.Ambassadors from the 27 remaining E.U. members agreed Monday to postpone the departure date until the end of January, although Britain could still leave earlier if Parliament ratifies the separation deal ahead of time. In Europe’s jargon-loving precincts, that means Britain has received a “flextension.”“The EU27 has agreed that it will accept the UK’s request for a #Brexit flextension until 31 January 2020,” European Council President Donald Tusk said Monday on Twitter. Ambassadors agreed to the deal without calling in national leaders for an in-person meeting, a sign that the decision ultimately was not especially controversial.Leaders are tired of debating Brexit at a moment when many European economies are flagging, extreme parties are still nipping at their heels and many citizens just want to move on. But they also fear igniting an economic blaze by kicking Britain out of the bloc before it is ready.Now Johnson plans to push for a general election in early December. Parliament is scheduled to debate election plans later Monday.Johnson will ask lawmakers — for the third time — to back his calls for a general election. Under 2011 legislation, Johnson needs the backing of two-thirds of the House of Commons to call an early election, meaning he needs opposition support. Johnson wants a Dec. 12 election, but without the Labour Party backing him, he appears likely to fail in this attempt. But there may be another route. Johnson’s government could back a plan by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party, which have suggested a Dec. 9 election. They could attempt to pass a one-line piece of legislation, which would need only a simple majority. The legislation, which would call for an election on that date and could be amended, could be passed as early as Tuesday. If greenlighted, it would mark the first time that Britain has held a general election in December since the 1920s. In a series of tweets, Nicola Sturgeon, the first minister of Scotland and leader of the Scottish National Party, explained why she was supporting an early general election. Doing nothing, she said, would allow Johnson to get his “bad deal through.” Or it could allow Johnson to run out the clock until the end of January, when a divorce from the E.U. without a deal, known as the no-deal Brexit, “becomes a real risk all over again,” she said.“For all his bluster, Johnson would much prefer to fight an election with Brexit already ‘delivered,’” Sturgeon tweeted. “An election now would instead force him to explain his failure to keep his 31 October ‘do or die’ promise and also defend his bad deal.”Some European leaders view Britain’s continued membership in the bloc with significant wariness. Monday’s delay was granted on the condition that British representatives in the E.U. agree not to obstruct the body’s decision-making while they linger inside the club, as Johnson has at times threatened to do.The E.U. leaders also want Johnson to name a European commissioner, a kind of senior E.U. bureaucrat, because each member country is required to do so under E.U. treaties. Naming someone would be another politically symbolic defeat for Johnson. Not naming a commissioner would violate the E.U. treaties, potentially opening the bloc’s decisions to legal challenges and upsetting the Europeans. Monday’s postponement still needs a final sign-off, because Johnson has to agree to it. Assuming everything goes as expected, it will be legally binding on Tuesday or Wednesday, just ahead of the current departure date on Thursday.Adam reported from London.

"Around the world, Baghdadi’s death greeted with celebration, caution and criticism",2019-10-28,World,"Despite spending his final years in hiding, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had a global notoriety few terrorists ever achieve. The Islamic State conquered swaths of Iraq and Syria under his leadership, inspired terrorist attacks in Europe and North America and set up an international network of fearsome affiliate groups.However, while the announcement on Sunday of Baghdadi’s death during a U.S. military operation in northwest Syria was welcomed in foreign capitals around the world, the reaction was clouded by differing views of President Trump’s strategy in Syria and concern about the Islamic State regrouping in the future.In France, where a wave of terror threats had included an Islamic State-claimed attack in November 2015 that left 130 dead in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron praised the operation but quickly added that the fight against the Islamic State could not die with Baghdadi.“The death of Al-Baghdadi is a hard blow against Islamic State, but it is just a stage,” Macron said in a tweet on Sunday. “With our partners in the international coalition, the fight continues to finally defeat this terrorist organization. This is our priority in the Middle East.”That sentiment was echoed by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted that Baghdadi’s death was “an important moment in our fight against terror but the battle against the evil of Daesh is not yet over,” using an acronym for an Arabic name of the Islamic State.Britain had also been targeted for high-profile attacks by Islamic State supporters during the era of Baghdadi, including a May 2017 bombing in Manchester that left 23 people dead. The attack was later claimed by the Islamic State.Benjamin Netanyahu, the embattled Israeli prime minister and a close ally of the U.S. president, issued a video message in which he offered his congratulations to Trump personally but added that “this is an important milestone, but it’s part of a longer battle that we must win.”In Jordan, the death was welcomed not only by political leaders. Safi al-Kasasbeh, whose son Muath was a Royal Jordanian Air Force pilot who was burned to death in an Islamic State video after his F-16 jet crashed over Syria in December 2014, said he was glad that a “tyrant and terrorist” had died.“I had hoped I would have the chance to kill him myself, but nevertheless this news of him being terminated has calmed the rage and fire inside me,” Kasasbeh said, according to Saudi-based newspaper Arab News.In Turkey, where the U.S. presence in Syria and its alliance with Kurdish groups had proven contentious, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said Baghdadi’s killing “marked a turning point in our joint fight against terrorism.""But in a tweet, Erdogan said that his country had paid the “dearest price” in the fight not only against the Islamic State but also the Kurdish Democratic Union Party of Syria, a group that had allied with the United States to fight the Islamic State.Having paid the dearest price in the fight against Daesh, PKK/YPG, and other terrorist organizations, Turkey welcomes this development. I am confident that a decisive struggle against terrorism, in line with the spirit of alliance, will bring peace to all of humanity.Countries at odds with the United States offered more complicated reactions. In Iran, which fought the Islamic State in Syria but was a frequent target of Trump’s ire, there was celebration of Baghdadi’s death but also unfounded speculation about American intentions and links to extremism.Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said Monday that “Iran’s logistic support” had helped defeat the Islamic State in Syria long before Baghdadi’s death and claimed that the Islamic State’s leaders had been supported by the United States.“It’s not that surprising that the U.S.’s move in killing Baghdadi is receiving so much media hype,” Mousavi said, according to a translation from the semiofficial Mehr news agency. “Every year close to the U.S. elections, Americans play such cards for domestic consumption.”Iran’s information minister Mohammed Javad Azari Jahromi also dismissed the killing, claiming that Trump had killed a “creature” created by the United States with a tweet on Sunday.Not a big deal! You just killed your creature. https://t.co/jrPuLWh5SmIn Russia, where local media had dismissed the U.S. operation to kill Baghdadi, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that they had not confirmed the death, but if it were true it was a major move in the fight against terrorism.“If the information about the death of al-Baghdadi is confirmed, we can say that the U.S. president has made a serious contribution to the fight against international terrorism,” Peskov said on a phone call with reporters on Monday. “The news itself cannot cause a negative response from the Russian authorities.”When Trump announced Baghdadi’s death on Sunday, the president thanked Syrian Kurdish forces and other nations, including Russia and Turkey. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said Sunday that Trump had told Russians before U.S. lawmakers; the president had said Sunday that Russians had been informed of the operation as U.S. forces were going to fly over certain “Russia-held areas” in Syria.",around world baghdadi ’ death greeted celebration caution criticism despite spending final year hiding abu bakr al-baghdadi global notoriety terrorist ever achieve islamic state conquered swath iraq syria leadership inspired terrorist attack europe north america set international network fearsome affiliate group however announcement sunday baghdadi ’ death u military operation northwest syria wa welcomed foreign capital around world reaction wa clouded differing view president trump ’ strategy syria concern islamic state regrouping future france wave terror threat included islamic state-claimed attack november left dead paris french president emmanuel macron praised operation quickly added fight islamic state could die baghdadi “ death al-baghdadi hard blow islamic state stage ” macron said tweet sunday “ partner international coalition fight continues finally defeat terrorist organization priority middle east ” sentiment wa echoed british prime minister boris johnson tweeted baghdadi ’ death wa “ important moment fight terror battle evil daesh yet ” using acronym arabic name islamic state britain also targeted high-profile attack islamic state supporter era baghdadi including may bombing manchester left people dead attack wa later claimed islamic state benjamin netanyahu embattled israeli prime minister close ally u president issued video message offered congratulation trump personally added “ important milestone ’ part longer battle must win ” jordan death wa welcomed political leader safi al-kasasbeh whose son muath wa royal jordanian air force pilot wa burned death islamic state video f- jet crashed syria december said wa glad “ tyrant terrorist ” died “ hoped would chance kill nevertheless news terminated ha calmed rage fire inside ” kasasbeh said according saudi-based newspaper arab news turkey u presence syria alliance kurdish group proven contentious president recep tayyip erdogan said baghdadi ’ killing “ marked turning point joint fight terrorism `` tweet erdogan said country paid “ dearest price ” fight islamic state also kurdish democratic union party syria group allied united state fight islamic state paid dearest price fight daesh pkk ypg terrorist organization turkey welcome development confident decisive struggle terrorism line spirit alliance bring peace humanity country odds united state offered complicated reaction iran fought islamic state syria wa frequent target trump ’ ire wa celebration baghdadi ’ death also unfounded speculation american intention link extremism iranian foreign ministry spokesman abbas mousavi said monday “ iran ’ logistic support ” helped defeat islamic state syria long baghdadi ’ death claimed islamic state ’ leader supported united state “ ’ surprising u ’ move killing baghdadi receiving much medium hype ” mousavi said according translation semiofficial mehr news agency “ every year close u election american play card domestic consumption ” iran ’ information minister mohammed javad azari jahromi also dismissed killing claiming trump killed “ creature ” created united state tweet sunday big deal ! killed creature http co jrpulwhsmin russia local medium dismissed u operation kill baghdadi kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said confirmed death true wa major move fight terrorism “ information death al-baghdadi confirmed say u president ha made serious contribution fight international terrorism ” peskov said phone call reporter monday “ news cause negative response russian authority ” trump announced baghdadi ’ death sunday president thanked syrian kurdish force nation including russia turkey house speaker nancy pelosi d-calif said sunday trump told russian u lawmaker president said sunday russian informed operation u force going fly certain “ russia-held area ” syria ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2019/10/28/around-world-baghdadis-death-greeted-with-celebration-caution-criticism/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
Mining Ghana’s bauxite would bring in billions from China. But it could also taint the water for 5 million people.,2019-10-28,World,"KYEBI, Ghana — Below the towering mahogany trees that blanket this lush mountainside, hidden beneath the brown-red soil, lie millions of tons of very valuable rock.This world-renowned forest reserve, called the Atewa, is the source of three major rivers that provide water to 5 million people. It is also home to an estimated 165 million tons of bauxite, a sedimentary rock used to create aluminum products such as aircraft parts, kitchen utensils and beer cans.Ghana’s leaders want to mine the bauxite, which they see as the country’s ticket to economic growth, thanks to a big-name partner — China. Campaigners and water experts say the environmental cost is too high: Mining would taint the water, they claim.“When you take the mountain off, you change the hydrology and ecology,” said Ronald Abrahams, a chief officer of the Water Resources Commission, the government agency tasked with managing the use of Ghana’s water resources. “It will not be the same. It will change everything, and we won't have a source of a river which is so reliable and has served this nation for ages.”Ghana is looking to mine bauxite to uphold what it calls a barter deal with China’s Sinohydro Corp. Limited. Sinohydro delivers $2 billion worth of infrastructure projects across the country, which Ghana would pay back with proceeds from the sale of the refined bauxite. (The Ghanaian government’s plans include building a refinery to process the raw bauxite.)China is the top buyer of minerals and rocks from Africa, pouring tens of billions of dollars into mining across the continent over the past decade — an investment that has fueled the country’s reign as the world’s largest aluminum producer.The Asian powerhouse is also Africa’s biggest funder of infrastructure projects. It has pledged reams of cash for roads, bridges, power plants and oil refineries.These buyer and funder identities often intersect as China offers big-ticket loans in exchange for access to lucrative resources in Ghana, Guinea, the Congo and beyond. But analysts say the high-profile deals, touted by both Chinese and African officials as a shared path to prosperity, rarely lift the continent’s poorest residents and can harm the environment.Neither the Chinese government, through its embassy in the Ghanaian capital, Accra, nor Sinohydro, which is a state-owned corporation, responded to requests for comment. Much is unknown about the government’s mining plans in the Atewa, a 90-square-mile tract of mountainous forestland. The three major rivers that originate there — the Densu, Birim and Ayensu — provide drinking water to three regions of Ghana, including to the 1 million people in Accra.Bauxite typically is found in the topsoil and extracted through strip mining, which requires removing layers of soil and rock to access the minerals below. Elsewhere, bauxite mining has had devastating consequences. A 2018 Human Rights Watch report on bauxite mining in Guinea found that the country’s dozens of open-pit operations had destroyed farmlands, damaged water sources, and coated homes and crops in dust.Environmental campaigners warn that if mining in the Atewa begins, runoff from the operations would contaminate the three rivers and smaller streams and would pollute surrounding areas with bauxite dust. Ultimately, they fear the evergreen forest — with its waterfalls and rare butterflies, frogs and monkeys — will disappear.Their worries were reinforced in March when the U.S. Forest Service visited the Atewa to provide technical consultation to Ghana’s government. Its report said mining could lead to a “potential significant and permanent impact” on the forest reserve and its importance as a water source.“If the forest is gone, it means the rainfall pattern will change, and that means our livelihoods will change,” said Emmanuel Tabi, a local assembly representative for the area. His constituents live near the forest and rely on it for water for use at home and on their farms.The U.S. report also pointed to what campaigners and those living in the communities surrounding the forest have complained of — a lack of transparency in the plans and how the impacts will be addressed. Abrahams, of the Water Resources Commission, said government representatives reassured him they were listening to concerns about the environmental impact at a workshop on bauxite mining and aluminum development this month. He hoped this meant the plans would be dropped.But in public comments, Ghana’s leaders seem resolute on mining the forest.Lands and Natural Resources Minister Kwaku Asomah-Cheremeh said in September that pilot exercises had shown the forest and water bodies would not be destroyed.He was echoing comments made by Ghanaian President Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, who dismissed claims that mining in the Atewa would threaten the creatures of the forest.“I am satisfied by what I have been told and what has been demonstrated to me that it is possible for us to get that red mud out without disturbing the wildlife that there is in the Atewa mountains,” he said at a sustainable development conference in May.The government agency responsible for carrying out the plans, the Ghana Integrated Aluminum Development Corporation, did not comment for this story despite multiple requests.A robust opposition to the plan has formed. Ghanaian environmental activists and organizations walked for six days from Atewa to Accra in March 2018, carrying water from the forest. They have erected billboards and placed a notice in Ghana's national newspaper in an attempt to dissuade mining companies from bidding for bauxite mining concessions. A collection of Ghanaian civil society organizations is now considering filing a class-action suit to protect the forest from mining.Kyebi, a community bordering the forest reserve, figured prominently in the last big fight over mining, in 2017. Ghana has long been known for its gold mining, but illegal small-scale mining so polluted bodies of water throughout Ghana that experts warned the country may have to import its water by 2020. A nationwide campaign followed, along with a temporary ban on all small mining operations. One of the most outspoken critics of illegal mines? Akufo-Addo, the president.Some residents of nearby towns say a mine would bring jobs to the area, and with jobs would come workers buying goods and services, like 41-year-old Ama Gifty Asare’s roadside breakfast food in the town of Odumase. “I don’t have a problem with it, for employment’s sake,” Asare said. “I will get to trade more.”Many others say they don’t like the plans.“Five million people use that water. It passed from village to village and town to town,” said Mohammed Awudu, a 52-year-old farmer whose house in Kyebi is a short walk from one of the rivers flowing from the Atewa. “Most in the community can't say anything about it. Most of us don't like it, but we can't say anything because we don't have power.”An environmental group called A Rocha Ghana has been leading the fight against the government’s plans, working to amplify voices like Awudu’s. On the lawn of the organization’s outpost in Kyebi is a reddish-brown boulder of bauxite, a reminder of what campaigners want the government to keep in the ground. A poster of Akufo-Addo lines one of the walls inside the office, his face next to a quote from his 2017 inauguration speech:“We should all recognize the danger we face by the alarming degradation of our environment and work to protect our water bodies, our forests, our lands, and the oceans.”Danielle Paquette in Dakar, Senegal, contributed to this report.West African countries plan to hike cocoa

"Argentine voters reject austerity, return Kirchner and the Peronistas to power in presidential election",2019-10-28,World,"BUENOS AIRES — The Peronista ticket of Alberto Fernández and former president Cristina Fernández de Kirchner defeated President Mauricio Macri in the first round of Argentina’s presidential election on Sunday, a rejection of austerity of the sort that has sparked violent protests elsewhere in Latin America.The left-leaning Kirchner, a former two-term president who ran as vice president to Fernández, is the target of nearly a dozen corruption cases. But she is popular among the poor and voters outside Buenos Aires, and the right-leaning Macri’s fiscal reforms failed to deliver the solid growth he promised.“I will meet President Macri tomorrow,” Fernández said late Sunday. “He is going to be the president until December 10, but I will cooperate in everything that Argentines need. …“Argentines must know that any commitment I made is an ethical commitment. We are going to build a solidarity and egalitarian Argentina that everybody dreams.”Kirchner said she would “ask the president who is still in office that he please take all the measures that should be taken to lighten the dramatic financial reality the country is undergoing.”Several South American countries have erupted in violent protest over the question of fiscal austerity vs. government largesse. On Sunday, this nation of 44 million put it to a vote.The choice was stark: Stick with the austerity program of Macri or return to the social spending of Kirchner and the Peronistas.When Macri took office in December 2015, he said his pro-market reforms would bring immediate and solid economic growth for 20 years. But at the end of his four-year term, poverty has increased by some 10 percentage points, annual inflation is over 50 percent and the public debt is equal to 100 percent of GDP, on the verge of default.Argentina has the third-largest economy in Latin America, after Brazil and Mexico.With nearly 96 percent of Argentina’s polling desks counted Sunday night, the Fernández-Kirchner ticket led Macri and running mate Miguel Ángel Pichetto, 48 percent to 40.4 percent. The leaders needed to win with at least 45 percent of the vote in the six-candidate field to avoid a head-to-head runoff election next month.Macri conceded shortly before 10:30 p.m.“I want to congratulate president-elect Alberto Fernández,” he told supporters. He said he had invited his successor to breakfast at Casa Rosada, the executive mansion.“We need an organized transition,” Macri said. “The only important thing is the future of the Argentines.”Argentina’s economy is collapsing. Here come the Peronistas, again.It was the result Raúl Montoya wanted. The 70-year-old computer consultant cast his ballot Sunday for Fernández and Kirchner.“I do trust in market-friendly policies, but Macri promised the earth four years ago,” Montoya said outside his polling station in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Caballito. He said the charges against Kirchner were politically motivated. Peronism, he said, “respects the rules of the market without leaving people to their own fate.”But Esther Rosas feared the return of Peronism — and, in particular, Kirchner.“I hope they don’t retaliate,” the 83-year-old pensioner said after voting for Macri in the Buenos Aires neighborhood of Villa Crespo. “Cristina is arrogant and corrupt.”Still, she said, she understood popular frustration with the incumbent: “Macri is a good engineer, but he tried to help only businessmen, forgetting the rest.”Macri, who held top positions in several businesses before running for office, faces federal charges himself on allegations that he tried to benefit his family’s firms. Both he and Kirchner deny wrongdoing; each blames the other for the charges against them.Kirchner, a former two-term president and first lady, is the modern face of Peronism, the populist political machine created in the 1940s by Juan and Eva “Evita” Perón that has returned to power periodically ever since, with mixed results. In Kirchner’s second term, from 2011 to 2015, a stagnant economy stopped generating jobs, inflation hit 25 percent, the fiscal deficit reached 5 percent and the country had no access to external financing.Macri’s election in 2015 was widely seen as a milestone for Argentina and Latin America: For the first time, a conservative candidate who proposed market orthodoxy to guarantee “sustainable growth” defeated a Peronist-led coalition that had pursued protectionist policies, expanded public spending and implemented a wide net of social assistance.Kirchner’s unusual decision to run as the vice presidential candidate to Fernández was seen by some as a recognition that although she has a loyal base, she is still deeply disliked by many voters and has a low electoral ceiling. Fernández, a chief of staff to her late husband and presidential predecessor Néstor Kirchner, left the administration a few months after Cristina Kirchner took office and became critical of her in the intervening decade.After the Fernández-Kirchner primary win in August, Macri announced tax cuts for the middle class, salary increases, social benefits and a fuel price freeze. The International Monetary Fund, meanwhile, suspended the last tranche of a record $57 billion deal that represents more than 60 percent of the IMF’s credit portfolio.Moody’s foresaw high probabilities of a sovereign default next year even if Macri were reelected.Macri reduced the primary deficit in the last year, but significantly increased the burden of debt service, which returns the fiscal deficit similar to that left by Kirchner in 2015, according to Carlos Melconián, head of the Macroview consultancy firm.Inflation hit 5.9 percent in September. By the end of the year, poverty will hit 40 percent, according to the Observatory of Social Debt at the Catholic University of Argentina. (The percentage is not comparable to others in Latin America because the poverty line in Argentina is based on higher standards.)Argentina’s Cristina Kirchner, facing corruption allegations, mounts unlikely comebackMassive protests against austerity measures in Chile and Ecuador and the electoral conflict in Bolivia weighed on Argentine public opinion in the days leading up to the vote. But while Argentina is suffering a recession reminiscent of its economic meltdown at the turn of the century, the campaign was relatively calm. Macri and Fernández headed massive rallies without significant incident.“Mass demonstrations are something common in Argentina, but the system of political parties has worked well in this country for many years, and that provides a certain stability,” said María Esperanza Casullo, a political scientist at the University of Rio Negro in Patagonia.Casullo said the next president risks the rapid deterioration of his approval rating.“Argentine society is deeply anti­hegemonic,” she said. “If expectations are not met, people punish those who fail to meet their expectations.”But she predicted the Peronistas would remain united, “because these years of Macri in office were really painful for them.”Eduardo Fidanza, director of the political consulting firm Poliarquia, predicted Argentines would allow Fernández and Kirchner a honeymoon. But he said they would have to clarify who was in charge. The running mates disagreed publicly on several points before resuming their old friendship in 2017.Peronism has majorities in the Congress, Fidanza noted, and maintains links with union leaders, industrial entrepreneurs and the Catholic Church.Macri pledged to strengthen democracy and ethics in government. Casullo said he was “naive.”“The reality proved to be more difficult than magically getting results by only removing the Kirchnerites,” she said. “Macri relied too much on slogans, underestimating what claims for an independent judiciary, a plural press and the respect of human rights really represent for many Argentines.”Lula González contributed to this report.Why political turmoil is erupting across Latin AmericaChile is the latest Latin American country to erupt in violent protest.

"Two Southwest pilots hid a camera in a plane’s lavatory and live-streamed video to the cockpit, according to lawsuit",2019-10-28,National,"Two Southwest Airlines pilots allegedly hid a camera in a plane’s lavatory and live-streamed the video to an iPad mounted on the windshield of the cockpit aboard a flight, according to a lawsuit filed by a flight attendant.The pilots recorded video of passengers and crew members aboard the February 2017 flight from Pittsburgh to Phoenix, according to the lawsuit filed in Arizona state court last year and recently transferred to federal court.Southwest in a statement Sunday denied the airline places cameras in its aircraft lavatories and said the 2017 incident was an “inappropriate attempt at humor.""In the suit, flight attendant Renee Steinaker alleges she saw an iPad streaming video from the plane’s forward lavatory when she entered the cockpit about 2 1/2 hours into Flight 1088. The captain, Terry Graham, had asked her to come into the cockpit so that he could use the lavatory. Southwest Airlines protocol requires a second person in the cockpit at all times.Steinaker saw the pilot in the streaming video on the iPad mounted on the windshield left of the flight captain’s seat, according to the lawsuit. The complaint said co-pilot Ryan Russell admitted to Steinaker that the iPad was streaming from a camera in the lavatory, but tried to convince her that the cameras were a “top-secret security measure installed in all of Southwest’s Boeing 737-800 planes.”Lion Air crash investigators fault Boeing 737 Max’s flight-control system, regulatory lapses and pilot trainingAccording to the lawsuit, Steinaker and passengers, including young children had used the forward lavatory. Both pilots are still flying for Southwest, the complaint said.The lawsuit was originally filed in an Arizona state court in October 2018 on behalf of Renee Steinaker and her husband, David Steinaker, also a Southwest flight attendant. In late August, it was moved to federal court in Phoenix. The Steinakers live in the Phoenix area.Ronald L.M. Goldman, an attorney for the couple, said the alleged live-streaming compromised safety.“The cockpit of a commercial airliner is not a playground for peeping Toms. Behavior that distracts and distresses crew members during flight compromises safety,” Goldman said in a statement.The Steinakers’ attorneys say the flight attendant has risked her career by making the incident public and has been subject to retaliation by Southwest. The attorney also said the three other flight attendants on Flight 1088, and Steinaker’s husband, who wasn’t on that flight, have faced harassment and been subjected to more than the usual performance audits and drug tests.When asked Sunday about the employment status of the pilots and the allegations of retaliation, Southwest Airlines declined to comment. “At this time, we have no other comment on the pending litigation,” the airline said.The lawsuit claims Steinaker was physically distressed and unable to work for several days after the incident, and continues to have “physical, emotional, and mental injuries as a result of the incident.”Court filings by attorneys for Dallas-based Southwest and the two pilots denied the live-streaming allegations, according to the Associated Press.In its statement, Southwest said when the incident happened, the airline investigated the allegations and addressed the situation with the crew involved.“We can confirm from our investigation that there was never a camera in the lavatory; the incident was an inappropriate attempt at humor which the company did not condone,” the airline said.It added: “The safety and security of our Employees and Customers is Southwest’s uncompromising priority. As such, Southwest does not place cameras in the lavatories of our aircraft.”",two southwest pilot hid camera plane ’ lavatory live-streamed video cockpit according lawsuit two southwest airline pilot allegedly hid camera plane ’ lavatory live-streamed video ipad mounted windshield cockpit aboard flight according lawsuit filed flight attendant pilot recorded video passenger crew member aboard february flight pittsburgh phoenix according lawsuit filed arizona state court last year recently transferred federal court southwest statement sunday denied airline place camera aircraft lavatory said incident wa “ inappropriate attempt humor `` suit flight attendant renee steinaker alleges saw ipad streaming video plane ’ forward lavatory entered cockpit hour flight captain terry graham asked come cockpit could use lavatory southwest airline protocol requires second person cockpit time steinaker saw pilot streaming video ipad mounted windshield left flight captain ’ seat according lawsuit complaint said co-pilot ryan russell admitted steinaker ipad wa streaming camera lavatory tried convince camera “ top-secret security measure installed southwest ’ boeing - plane ” lion air crash investigator fault boeing max ’ flight-control system regulatory lapse pilot trainingaccording lawsuit steinaker passenger including young child used forward lavatory pilot still flying southwest complaint said lawsuit wa originally filed arizona state court october behalf renee steinaker husband david steinaker also southwest flight attendant late august wa moved federal court phoenix steinakers live phoenix area ronald l goldman attorney couple said alleged live-streaming compromised safety “ cockpit commercial airliner playground peeping tom behavior distracts distress crew member flight compromise safety ” goldman said statement steinakers ’ attorney say flight attendant ha risked career making incident public ha subject retaliation southwest attorney also said three flight attendant flight steinaker ’ husband ’ flight faced harassment subjected usual performance audit drug test asked sunday employment status pilot allegation retaliation southwest airline declined comment “ time comment pending litigation ” airline said lawsuit claim steinaker wa physically distressed unable work several day incident continues “ physical emotional mental injury result incident ” court filing attorney dallas-based southwest two pilot denied live-streaming allegation according associated press statement southwest said incident happened airline investigated allegation addressed situation crew involved “ confirm investigation wa never camera lavatory incident wa inappropriate attempt humor company condone ” airline said added “ safety security employee customer southwest ’ uncompromising priority southwest doe place camera lavatory aircraft ” ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/transportation/2019/10/27/two-southwest-pilots-hid-camera-planes-lavatory-live-streamed-video-cockpit-according-lawsuit/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
"This church gave its parishioners $60,000 and told them to pay it forward. Here’s what happened.",2019-10-28,National,"The pews were packed one Sunday last month inside the Good Shepherd Lutheran Church outside of Cincinnati, with everyone awaiting a surprise announcement from pastor Heidi Johns. The pastor stood in front of the congregation and asked everyone to send a family member up front to pick out a sealed envelope.Inside each envelope was a check for $100, $250 or $500, with the “pay to the order of” section left blank.“I want you to take these gifts of grace and go out and bless the world,” Johns recalled telling church members on Sept. 8. “Do something meaningful with these checks. If you can, multiply them — add some money of your own or put in some sweat equity. Think of ways that you can make the most impact.” Johns said every person in the church, located in Kenwood, Ohio, was beaming with excitement.“When they opened the envelopes and saw the checks, one man described it as a ‘happy burden,’” said Johns. “Everyone realized the seriousness of doing the very best they could with the money to make the most difference.” In all, $60,000 was handed out to about 250 families that day to give to any needy person or charity they desired.Why 1,000 people offered to crowd-stitch the quilt of a dead woman none of them knewThe money was a portion of a larger sum bequeathed to the Good Shepherd church by Ruth Grassman, a longtime parishioner with no children who had quietly built up her savings over the years. Grassman died in May 2018, just a few months shy of her 100th birthday, Johns said.“After the church received the money she’d left us a year ago, I started thinking about ways to involve the congregation in using some of Ruth’s generous gift,” she said.Johns recalled reading a story about a check giveaway project, in which the Preston Meadow Lutheran Church in Plano, Tex., gave away cash with instructions to go forth and do good with the money. She decided to do something similar.“It was so exciting last month to finally surprise everyone with a check and then find out what they planned to do with the money,” said Johns, 55.After she encouraged parishioners to leave stories about their experiences on the church’s website, the results soon started flowing in.“Some people gave their checks to hurricane relief, homeless shelters, care of the environment and animals or food pantries that feed hungry people,” Johns said. “Then there were people who know someone close to them who has gotten sick, lost a job or has medical bills they can’t pay, so they put their checks to use helping them.” “It was a heartwarming experience to see what everyone came up with,” she said.Having trouble sleeping? Try forgiving someone.After drawing a check for $250, Rachel and David Bea decided to match it and spend $500 on toys, books, socks and snacks to create 20 “smile bags” for children in need. With help from their children, Arleigh, 5, and Jaren, 4, they put the bags together and handed them out to kids they spotted at their local park or food pantry who they thought might be able to use them, said Rachel Bea, 37.“We wanted our kids to learn the impact of giving rather than receiving, and to experience how wonderful it feels to help others,” she said. “I had Arleigh make a little card to put in each bag that says, ‘Smile.’”“I felt proud to do it,” Arleigh said. “It was a lot of fun.” “I felt really happy,” Jaren added. “It made me feel good inside.” “One of the best things about this is that the kids didn’t ask once to keep any of the toys for themselves,” Rachel Bea said.Katie and Ron Zink contributed $150 of their own money to a homeless shelter and let their two daughters, Josie, 14, and Sara, 12, decide how to spend their $100 check from the church.Both girls had made sandwiches in the past at their school for a bag lunch program offered by St. Francis Seraph Ministries in Cincinnati, said Katie Zink, 41.“They decided that would be the best use of the money, especially since the program helps day laborers who can’t afford to buy themselves a lunch,” she said. “Most of these people don’t make more than $35 a day.” For Bill and Kathy Shuman, there was no question where they would use their $500 check. The retired couple volunteers every week at Cincinnati’s William Howard Taft Elementary School, where the majority of the students qualify for free or reduced lunch.After volunteering one afternoon earlier this year, Kathy Shuman stopped to talk to the music teacher and learned about a special need for rhythm instruments, said Bill Shuman, 72.“We’d been struggling the past few months, hoping to find a way to help him to realize that dream, and then we happened to get that $500 check,” said Bill Shuman.The pair purchased enough recorders for every student in the third to sixth grades, along with several sets of percussion tubes.“Playing music helps the kids with academics, helps them establish focus and gives them a positive way to burn off some steam,” said teacher Dan Larkin Jr., who has 300 music students.He said the gift was completely unexpected.“What a tremendous surprise,” Larkin said. “I’m beyond grateful.” Read more: How a town came together to rescue a missing 6-year-old — and used a thermal camera on a drone to find himThis Miami bus driver performed CPR on a passenger.

Six people were also bruised or cut with broken glass while trying to escape, he said.The shooting happened about 12:05 a.m. at an event space called the Party Venue, a barnlike structure along a stretch of Highway 380 northeast of Dallas. About 750 teenagers and 20-somethings were crowded inside and around the venue, some of them in Halloween costumes.When the shots rang out, law enforcement officers were already on the scene: A Hunt County Sheriff’s Office sergeant and deputy had arrived after receiving complaints about cars parked illegally along the shoulder of the highway. They were outside the front of the building, Meeks said, questioning a partygoer who appeared to be intoxicated to the point of incapacitation.Gunfire erupted in the back of the building, away from the off-duty officer working at the event. Then came pandemonium as hundreds of people tried frantically to escape.“They were breaking the glass of the windows trying to get out [of] the building,” Meeks said. “My deputies said there was four abreast trying to get out the front door.” In the chaos, the shooter — believed to be a man — was able to get away.Two unidentified men were found dead at the scene. Meeks credited law enforcement officers with potentially saving the lives of other shooting victims, noting that one deputy loaded a man with life-threatening injuries into his patrol vehicle and drove him to a hospital while another helped other victims.The investigation has been somewhat complicated by the Halloween costumes worn by revelers. Authorities initially reported that a rifle was used in the shooting, only to say later that the weapon was a handgun. Rifle rounds found on the floor turned out to be fake — potentially part of a costume.Meeks said investigators have theorized that the shooter may have been targeting the first of the two men who were killed. But the investigation, which is being assisted by the Texas Rangers and the FBI, is in its early stages and has been hampered by the reluctance of witnesses to come forward. Investigators had spoken with about 20 people who had not given a “good description of the shooter or who they think he may be,” Meeks said.The sheriff said the public is not believed to be at risk. But he urged people to come forward with information about the gunman.“We need to get him off the street as soon as possible,” he said. “And we have very, very little to go on right now.” Read more:‘All my friends are dead’: One raced to Tree of Life, the other stayed home.

California forecasters saw the ‘devil wind’ storm coming. It’s the worst-case scenario for wildfires.,2019-10-28,National,"A historic fire weather event is unfolding in California, as ferocious down-sloping “Diablo Winds” propel the large and dangerous Kincade Fire toward heavily populated areas.As of early Sunday morning, the dire forecast scenarios outlined in the preceding days appear to have materialized. Mount St. Helena in Napa County reported sustained winds at 66 mph and gusts to 82 mph; another station near the Kincade Fire, in Healdsburg Hills in Sonoma County, reported 80 mph gusts. Healdsburg Hills North saw a gust to 93 mph.With wildfire movement rapidly evolving, the Sonoma County sheriff’s office issued a dire alert for residents in parts of Santa Rosa: “Leave while you still can.” Roughly 175,000 people live in the city of Santa Rosa, and many of them will join the 90,000 in Sonoma County who were already told to get out.And while people fled, fires continued to pop up, fueled by unrelenting winds and bone-dry air.Overnight progression of the #KincadeFire as seen on GOES-17 Satellite Fire Temperature imagery. Loop runs from 10:01 pm to 4:16 am PDT. #CAwx #CAFire pic.twitter.com/ZDAoukbvbvForecasters knew several days ago that this weekend’s conditions had the potential to equal, and possibly exceed, those of the October 2017 North Bay firestorms. The worst of those fires, the Tubbs Fire, destroyed 5,636 structures and killed 22 people as it swept across Sonoma County, across subdivisions and into Santa Rosa the night of Oct. 8, 2017.Unlike the 2017 event, however, the ongoing windstorm is forecast to last nearly two days and be closely followed by more potential offshore wind events in the coming week. It’s also affecting lower elevations more than typical high-wind events do in this region.[Evacuation orders expand significantly as wildfires spread in historic windstorm]For Sunday, the Storm Prediction Center has parts of the North Bay at “extremely critical” fire danger, its highest fire weather risk category, over an area that includes Napa County, neighboring Solano and Colusa counties, and Yolo County near Sacramento, where meteorologists expect sustained winds to peak between 35 and 50 mph and for gusts to top 70 mph. Widespread relative humidity readings below 10 percent will continue as dry, downslope winds spread across the region.Strong upper-level winds, moving in concert with northeasterly surface winds, are helping to strengthen gusts at the surface, leading to “explosive fire growth potential.""Craig Clements, a fire meteorologist at San Jose State University, expected that these conditions would develop. On Saturday, while thousands were traveling south on the US 101 freeway to escape the fire danger, Clements was heading north to the front lines of the Kincade Fire.The mass exodus seemed warranted.“This is going to be a wind-driven fire like no one’s seen before,” he said in a Saturday afternoon interview. “This is probably one of the biggest weather incidents in California history.”Clements and his team at the Fire Weather Research Lab deploy sophisticated technology, including a truck-mounted radar, to study how extreme fires behave and spread, a field in which real-world data is lacking.“We’re collecting weather data near the fire fronts to both understand extreme fire behavior but also to have a data set for testing next-generation fire behavior models,” he said. These newer models consider not only how weather drives fire, but also how the heat from the fire feeds back into the weather system.#kincadefire extreme fire behavior with flame lengths and flame heights 100s of feet.

The winds are drying the air out as they descend over the Sierra Nevada and into the Sacramento Valley and again as they move down the lower-elevation coast ranges.Null said that although this event is likely to be similar in magnitude to the October 2017 windstorm, it could be put into historical context only after a detailed analysis.Meteorologists, though, have a quick way to determine its overall strength; they look at the pressure gradient, or the difference in surface air pressure, between San Francisco (lower pressure area) and Winnemucca in northern Nevada (higher pressure area). During the 2017 North Bay firestorms, that gradient was -17.8 millibars. The latest overnight reading had the gradient at -11.5 and counting.In general, the greater the pressure gradient, the higher the winds will be, as air flows from higher to lower pressure.Whether a windstorm becomes a firestorm that becomes a disaster is not just about the large-scale weather pattern, but a series of contributing factors. These include population growth near forested areas, evacuation decisions, the dryness of vegetation and more.Climate lays the foundation for wildfire by affecting how dry vegetation will become, and how easily it will burn. As the climate has warmed, vegetation is drying out faster.With repeated dry winds, combined with brief but record-breaking heat waves in California over the summer and fall, plants are now extremely dry around the Bay Area and the North Bay.If the Tubbs Fire had erupted 10 miles farther north, for example, “you change the whole metric for what the impacts are,” Null said.“It’s not just the wind, it’s a cascade of events,” he said.",california forecaster saw ‘ devil wind ’ storm coming ’ worst-case scenario wildfire historic fire weather event unfolding california ferocious down-sloping “ diablo wind ” propel large dangerous kincade fire toward heavily populated area early sunday morning dire forecast scenario outlined preceding day appear materialized mount st helena napa county reported sustained wind mph gust mph another station near kincade fire healdsburg hill sonoma county reported mph gust healdsburg hill north saw gust mph wildfire movement rapidly evolving sonoma county sheriff ’ office issued dire alert resident part santa rosa “ leave still ” roughly people live city santa rosa many join sonoma county already told get people fled fire continued pop fueled unrelenting wind bone-dry air overnight progression # kincadefire seen goes- satellite fire temperature imagery loop run pm pdt # cawx # cafire pic twitter com zdaoukbvbvforecasters knew several day ago weekend ’ condition potential equal possibly exceed october north bay firestorm worst fire tubbs fire destroyed structure killed people swept across sonoma county across subdivision santa rosa night oct unlike event however ongoing windstorm forecast last nearly two day closely followed potential offshore wind event coming week ’ also affecting lower elevation typical high-wind event region sunday storm prediction center ha part north bay “ extremely critical ” fire danger highest fire weather risk category area includes napa county neighboring solano colusa county yolo county near sacramento meteorologist expect sustained wind peak mph gust top mph widespread relative humidity reading percent continue dry downslope wind spread across region strong upper-level wind moving concert northeasterly surface wind helping strengthen gust surface leading “ explosive fire growth potential `` craig clements fire meteorologist san jose state university expected condition would develop saturday thousand traveling south u freeway escape fire danger clements wa heading north front line kincade fire mass exodus seemed warranted “ going wind-driven fire like one ’ seen ” said saturday afternoon interview “ probably one biggest weather incident california history ” clements team fire weather research lab deploy sophisticated technology including truck-mounted radar study extreme fire behave spread field real-world data lacking “ ’ collecting weather data near fire front understand extreme fire behavior also data set testing next-generation fire behavior model ” said newer model consider weather drive fire also heat fire feed back weather system # kincadefire extreme fire behavior flame length flame height foot conifer torching ridge top surface wind mph pic twitter com uaknjcvawhile swarm scientist weather enthusiast seek severe thunderstorm tornado “ ’ team deploys fire ” said anticipates kincade fire case study team “ ember going cast lofted long distance ” enabling fast spread fire ultimate goal san jose state university fire lab like research institution country save life providing better forecast firefighter community lie fire ’ path go indicates fire crossing pixel size projection issue take ground truth report long range spot good # windsor # healdsburg # kincadefire # cawx pic twitter com guklwqnbijan null meteorologist spent year national weather service forecaster gave nefarious autumn wind plague coastal mountain range san francisco bay area name diablo “ devil ” wind common october month without rain wind fanned deadly destructive fire including tunnel fire killed people destroyed nearly structure hill oakland benign source cold air mass resulting high-pressure center establishes near northern nevada utah area known “ great basin ” saturday night high-pressure center western montana began funneling wind toward much lower pressure california coast wind drying air descend sierra nevada sacramento valley move lower-elevation coast range null said although event likely similar magnitude october windstorm could put historical context detailed analysis meteorologist though quick way determine overall strength look pressure gradient difference surface air pressure san francisco lower pressure area winnemucca northern nevada higher pressure area north bay firestorm gradient wa -

"Want to fight anti-Semitism, a year after Pittsburgh? Here’s one easy way.",2019-10-28,PostEverything,"One year ago, a gunman spouting anti-Semitic rhetoric walked into a sacred Jewish space, Tree of Life synagogue, and took the lives of 11 treasured members of Pittsburgh’s Jewish community.In the weeks that followed, a tremor passed through Jewish organizations, homes, dorm rooms and Facebook feeds. American Jews were in a state of collective shock and mourning, and it wasn’t just for the compassionate men and women who were taken that day in Pittsburgh. For many of us, Pittsburgh marked the end of an assumption that had comforted our families for generations: that in America, Jews were safe.For me, the event landed a bit differently: I felt all mourning and no shock. That’s because in 2005, fresh out of college, I took on a research project that changed my life. I was a student activist facing what felt like an insurmountable task — to offer a mirror to leftist social justice movements about the tricky, highly sensitive question of how to recognize and respond to anti-Semitism in our ranks.When I started my research, charges of anti-Semitism were already so politicized in campus debates over Israel and Palestine that leftist activists tended to suspect the sincerity of anyone who raised it. To complicate matters, they tended to have a clearer understanding of oppression that limited people’s opportunities, like racism and classism. From this perspective, anti-Semitism, as terrible as it was, seemed like a thing of the past. If so many Jews in the United States today were white and financially stable, could they really be a group that needed advocacy? Hoping to help the left integrate a better understanding of anti-Semitism, I set out to understand it better myself: not just how it played out in history, but also what it looked like in the present, here and abroad, and across the political spectrum.What I learned left me sobered. Anti-Semitism thrives under conditions of social discontent and instability. It paints an imagined picture of Jews — whether it’s the Jewish people as a whole, a nefarious Jewish figure, a shadowy cabal or the Jewish state — as holding unique power, able to influence world events more than normal people can. Although modern anti-Semitism as we know it today grew out of right-wing movements, it has a knack for flexibility. Because it looks less like victim-blaming than like a critique of power, it can make its way into unexpected conversations and coalitions, and out of the mouths of well-meaning people.Why do anti-Semites hate Jews? Because we Jews have the power to fight them.Anti-Semitism finds a niche across the political spectrum because of the explanatory power it carries. In periods of social upheaval — when inequality no longer feels tolerable, or when groups of people who once felt safe from inequality worry that they are losing their grip — people ask what is causing their problems. Anti-Semitism offers an answer: It’s the Jews.For the accused shooter in Pittsburgh, this apparently took the form of one particular conspiracy theory: the one in which the Jews are conspiring to undermine white society. Tree of Life members had spent a recent Shabbat promoting compassion for refugees. Anti-Semitism meant their killer couldn’t picture Jews as regular people — people who remembered the powerlessness of being refugees and wanted no one else to have to suffer that way. Instead, the accused shooter was sure Jews were plotting behind the scenes, subverting borders and using immigrants to pose a genocidal threat to white people.Over the years, this particular variant of anti-Semitism has taken many forms, like the idea that the civil rights movement was secretly directed by Jews — an idea that, of course, depends on deeply rooted denial of black intellect and resistance. But it’s only one of many conspiracies attributed to Jews. Whether it’s controlling banks, wars or the media, the core of modern anti-Semitism is the conspiracy itself.This customizable conspiracy theory makes anti-Semitism useful for propping up unjust power structures. After all, when “the Jews” explain any lack of power that ordinary people feel, those people are less likely to unite to change the power structure itself. While the first reason that social justice movements should stand up against anti-Semitism is that Jews deserve to live free of fear, the second reason is this: As long as there’s a decoy explanation for what ails society, any social movement will have a hard time organizing to win real change.* * *During the 2016 presidential campaign, I wasn’t one of those who saw a Hillary Clinton win as a safe bet. White voters on the right were expressing clear anxiety about challenges to their traditional position of power. The thing about whiteness that makes losing it so unbearable is that it has insulated white people from the full brunt of inequality. In our world, very few people’s lives count for as much as profit does. But whiteness has helped white people — including many Jewish people in the postwar United States — to avoid facing that reality. Whiteness doesn’t just give people physical protection from the daily violence and exploitation against black, brown and indigenous people; it gives white people a way to believe that they have value, even in an economy where that is less and less true.As I watched white voters gear up for 2016, I didn’t like the odds of what was coming. I feared for the physical safety of my black, Muslim and immigrant friends, and I was pretty sure that Jews would also become a target. My research had prepared me for the rise in brutal anti-Semitic rhetoric that the campaign and election unleashed and for the violence I knew would follow. With a heavy heart, I had been expecting an event like Pittsburgh long before it finally came.Today, white nationalist violence is speeding up toward so many of us. Like black communities in Charleston and Jeffersontown, Muslims in Quebec City and Christchurch, and Mexican Americans in El Paso, Jews are grappling with how to achieve safety. What would legislation look like? How can we safeguard our spaces — as Jews in Halle, Germany, had to — without turning to security forces that could put Jews and allies of color at risk?The victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue massacre were martyrsTwo things are clear to me. First, we can only get through this together. Jews can only survive this with our many allies from other targeted groups fighting at our sides — and we need to realize that anyone who targets our allies is no real friend of ours. Second, no top-down solution will be enough to fix this. Anti-Semitism is a decentralized ideology, freely available online to all. So are untraceable guns and the online communities where recruits learn to point them at us.Luckily, one of the best ways to fight anti-Semitism is also free and accessible to all. It’s one of the simplest tools we have, and it can preempt attacks: We need to talk openly about how inequality works.Anti-Semitism has staying power because it offers an explanation of why the world is so broken. It says the roots of inequality are hidden, and suggests they can be found. This is so attractive because a lot of inequality doesn’t get spoken about. Sometimes that’s by design — like when tax havens cover up massive private wealth, depriving our societies of more robust social services. Sometimes that’s out of social convention, since many of us, especially people with wealth, are raised to think of money and how we get it as a personal subject, impolite to discuss.That’s why some of the best tools I’ve seen to fight anti-Semitism weren’t about Jews at all. They were movies, podcasts and face-to-face conversations that brought these questions out in the open. They spoke in simple terms about how our economy and other systems of inequality really work — which meant listeners who felt frustrated, angry or without power didn’t have to go looking for a secret cause.I know that many of my gentile friends have asked themselves, “Would I have spoken up during the Holocaust?” — just as Jews like me have grown up looking at gentile friends in our lives and asking ourselves, “Would they have hidden me?” Speaking up inside a fascist state carries unthinkable risk. We are more fortunate. We live in a time when all of us can stand in the way of anti-Semitism, just by educating ourselves about economics and power, and by taking the time, patience and humility to share what we learn with people in our families and communities.On the day of the Tree of Life killings, my first feeling was wildly irrational. Because I had been expecting the worst for some time, I felt a gratitude no human being should ever have to feel: that the men and women whose lives were cut short at Tree of Life had been able to live relatively long, full years; that they had had a chance, if too short, to experience joys which many of our people throughout history did not survive to experience. When reports circulated that the shooting had interrupted a baby naming, I imagined a baby shielded by Jewish elders, being gifted with a possibility to live on and make it to a future where things like this don’t happen anymore. These are thoughts no person should have to have; mental silver linings to which the mind could only contort in an obscenely tarnished world.Pittsburgh leaves us all thinking about how we can oppose anti-Semitism. But anti-Semitism doesn’t just come from hatred or ignorance — it’s a predictable effect of structural inequality. If we want to save lives, we need to stop pretending that this teetering structure can keep balancing like this forever. For all of our safety, let’s start having real conversations about what’s broken, and what it will take to make the world whole.Read more:Trump doesn’t understand how anti-Semitism works.

Is Trump repeating one of the worst foreign policy blunders in history?,2019-10-28,PostEverything,"Two weeks ago, in remarks eerily reminiscent of claims British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain made after the disastrous Munich conference in 1938, President Trump hailed the “cease-fire agreement” that Vice President Pence brokered between the Turks and the Kurds as an “incredible outcome” and a “great day for civilization.”A week later, the president went further. Gushing about the agreement that Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan reached over Syria, Trump went as far as to claim credit for the Turkish-Russian accord that vastly extended the “safe zone” Turkey sought to establish through its military offensive and that has driven more than 160,000 Kurds from their homes. He then reiterated this claim in the remarks he made following his announcement that Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi died in a U.S. Special Forces operation, saying that he was “glad” he was “able to help” Turkey build this safe zone.In late September 1938, Chamberlain made a similar claim about his negotiations with Adolf Hitler. The German dictator wanted to annex the area of Czechoslovakia that bordered Germany known as the Sudetenland. Hitler falsely claimed that the Czechs were slaughtering the largely German-speaking population of the region, and as the threat of a German incursion intensified, so, too, did the fear that such a move would lead to the outbreak of a Second World War. To forestall such an outcome, Chamberlain met in Munich with Hitler and his French and Italian counterparts.The results directly precipitated World War II, revealing the fallacies of appeasement and the dangers present today.Although Chamberlain is remembered in infamy, the theory behind appeasement wasn’t unreasonable. Britain was underarmed and faced three potential adversaries in Germany, Italy and Japan. So trying to come to terms with one or more of these aggressive powers made a good deal of sense.That explains why, at Munich, Chamberlain, who, like Trump, had little experience in foreign policy, agreed to Hitler’s demands to hand over the Sudetenland, despite not consulting with the Czechs or their allies in Soviet Russia.Chamberlain naively took Hitler at his word and was actually thrilled that the German dictator agreed to sign a statement declaring that their deal over the Czech borderlands was “symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war with one another again.” He then returned to London a hero and, waving the paper he and Hitler had signed over his head to an adoring crowd at the airport, insisted that the deal was but the prelude to a “larger settlement in which all Europe may find peace.” Later that day, he famously asserted that the joint declaration meant not only “peace with honor” but “peace for our time.”Not everyone agreed. A disgusted Winston Churchill — whom Trump claims to admire — bluntly confronted Chamberlain in the House of Commons “You were given the choice between war and dishonor,” Churchill declared. “You chose dishonor and you will have war.”In Washington, President Franklin D. Roosevelt, whose freedom of action was severely curtailed by an isolationist Congress and public, privately conceded to his top political and military advisers that the Munich settlement represented a fundamental shift in the balance of power in Europe and a direct threat to the United States, particularly given the advent of air power. Roosevelt then told his stunned military chiefs that he wanted an air force of 10,000 planes and the ability to produce 20,000 aircraft per year.Churchill and Roosevelt proved prescient.Before losing the Sudetenland, Czechoslovakia was the sixth-largest industrial power in Europe and possessed an army in 1938 that was roughly equivalent to that of Hitler’s, supported by one of the most highly productive arms industries on the continent. Fearful of German aggression, the Czechoslovaks had built extensive fortifications along their border with Germany and had signed a military alliance with France and Soviet Russia in 1935. But without these fortifications and the Franco-Russian alliance, the rest of Czechoslovakia was all but defenseless. Less than six months after Munich, Germany took over the rest of Czechoslovakia, and Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement was dead.The negative reverberations of Chamberlain’s blunder spread far beyond Czechoslovakia. After Czechoslovakia’s fall and the enhancement of German power through the takeover of the Czech arms industry, all Britain could do was guarantee the territorial integrity of Hitler’s next target: Poland. Chamberlain also sought to try to secure an alliance over Poland’s defense with the Soviet Union.But Chamberlain’s cavalier lack of consultation with the Soviet Union before Munich — despite its military ties to Prague — proved disastrous. Joseph Stalin interpreted the settlement as an attempt by the Western powers to strengthen Hitler and threaten him. He quickly concluded that his prior attempt to form military alliances with the Western powers in opposition to Hitler had been a mistake.So instead of agreeing to an alliance with Britain, Stalin signed a nonaggression pact with Hitler that divided Eastern Europe into German and Soviet spheres of influence and cleared the way for Hitler to attack Poland. On Sept. 1, 1939, less than a year after Chamberlain had signed the Munich agreement, Hitler’s armies marched into Poland, and the dream of “peace for our time” lay shattered in the ruins of the Second World War.Chamberlain’s lack of diplomatic experience and determination to fashion his own foreign policy was his downfall. He often refused to listen to his top foreign policy advisers — as evidenced by the resignation of British Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden over Chamberlain’s headlong pursuit of the appeasement of Italian dictator Benito Mussolini six months before the Munich agreements were signed.Taking the word of dictators such as Mussolini and Hitler at face value was a fatal flaw that was compounded by Chamberlain’s hubris. He vastly underappreciated the potentially devastating consequences of his actions and undersold them to the public. In a radio address amid the Sudeten crisis, Chamberlain justified his determination to appease Hitler by asking the British people why they should become involved in “a quarrel in a faraway country between peoples of whom we know nothing.”Today, Trump is repeating not only Chamberlain’s policy of appeasement but also the mistakes that underlay that policy. He ignores counsel from his military and diplomatic advisers and takes dictators such as Putin and Erdogan — whom he referred to as a “good friend” and “great leader” — at their word.And, like Chamberlain, he does not appreciate the threats that might be brewing as a result of his actions and has done his best to play down the potential consequences in his public statements. In words evocative of Chamberlain’s reference to the Czechs as “a far away people,” Trump claims that we no longer need to worry about the Islamic State because they are “7,000 miles away” and even if some Islamic State prisoners being held by the beleaguered Kurds escape, “they will be escaping to Europe.”This, of course, sorely underestimates the danger of a terrorist attack on American soil or on U.S. installations overseas, as the United States learned on 9/11. It is not distance, but our ability to control the ground in northeastern Syria with the help of our Kurdish allies — which we have now lost — that has been the critical factor in our ability to contain the threat posed by the Islamic State. Nor will the killing of one man — Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi — alter this fundamental equation. Trump refuses to see this and prefers to “let someone else fight over this bloodstained sand.”Most damaging, however, is the outright betrayal that the president’s abandonment of the Kurds represents. Here, Trump’s callous dismissal of an ally that has lost more than 10,000 fighters helping us destroy the Islamic State’s considerable base of power, is certainly on par with Chamberlain’s callous dismissal of the Czechoslovakian people in 1938.Eight decades ago, Chamberlain thought he could contain the threat that Hitler represented by handing the dictator territory that had never belonged to Germany. He was wrong. Similarly, Trump’s decision to allow Turkey to gain control over northern Syria and leave the Kurds to their fate has already had consequences that stretch well beyond Syria’s borders.It has emboldened Iran, strengthened Russian President Vladimir Putin’s influence in the region, alienated our allies, and — whatever one might say about the welcome demise of Baghdadi — granted the Islamic State a new lease on life. Worse still, it has irreparably damaged American credibility. There is also no guarantee that ceding control over northern Syria to the Turks and Bashar al-Assad and his Russian allies will bring peace and stability to this troubled part of the world. On the contrary, it may well result in the need to send a far larger American force into the region in the future. Viewed from this perspective, the charge that Churchill laid against Chamberlain could also be leveled against Trump: “You were given the choice between war and dishonor. You chose dishonor and you will have war.”",trump repeating one worst foreign policy blunder history two week ago remark eerily reminiscent claim british prime minister neville chamberlain made

"Job quantity, check. Job quality, not check.",2019-10-28,PostEverything,"The problem facing the current U.S. labor market is not job quantity. It’s job quality. Over this record-length expansion, U.S. employers have created over 20 million private-sector jobs at a pace of 1.7 percent per year (providing another reminder that the myth of job-killing robots is just that). Historically, that’s a healthy rate, and with unemployment at a 50-year low of 3.5 percent, if all we cared about was the number of jobs, we’d have little to complain about, at least at the aggregate level. (There are, of course, places where job gains have been much less impressive).But we also care about the quality of jobs, which raises the question: What’s a good job? Thankfully, a new Gallup survey provides a uniquely deep dive into that question. Before we ourselves dive into the details, let’s get two top-line observations out of the way. First, wages matter, but they are far from the only thing that matters. Second, even in today’s strong job market, a minority of Americans — 40 percent — report having good jobs.The study defines good jobs along a variety of dimensions beyond compensation (pay and benefits), including whether pay and hours of work are stable and predictable. Control over hours and scheduling is also important. There are too many workers who can’t leave their workplace, even to care for a sick child, without being docked pay or worse. Having a sense of purpose at work, career advancement opportunities and having the power to change things that aren’t working for you round off the definition.Based on about 6,600 workers’ subjective responses along these lines, 40 percent had good jobs, 44 percent had mediocre jobs and 16 percent had bad jobs. These shares varied in ways that are both predictable and surprising. Among the lowest income workers, 30 percent had bad jobs, compared to only 4 percent at the top of the income scale. About twice the share of African American workers had bad jobs compared to white workers (25 percent vs. 13 percent), and black women are particularly likely to hold bad jobs (31 percent).But the gradient of job quality by education is less steep than you might expect. Among graduates of four-year colleges, 42 percent had good jobs, compared to 40 percent for high school grads. One sobering finding is that the worst outcome for job quality by education is for workers who started but didn’t finish college. Presumably, these are people who are stuck with college debt but don’t get the earning power bestowed by a college degree.Unsurprisingly, workers differ little in terms of what they value at work. Where they differ, by income level, is whether they their jobs actually give them that. For example, it’s important to about 90 percent of low- and high-income workers alike that their pay is stable and predictable. After all, our bills — rent/mortgage payments, gas, child care, college tuition — are, like it or not, generally stable and predictable. But while 90 percent of high-income workers are satisfied with the predictability of their pay, only 56 percent of low-income workers share that sense of satisfaction.This is a critical insight that we usually miss in the way most of us look at wage trends. That is, we applaud, for good reason, increases in pay, but we pay too little attention to wage levels. No question, a positive trend moves a low-wage worker in the right direction, but data just out from the Bureau of Labor Statistics provides an excellent example of what I’m talking about.Thanks to the tight job market, employers have had to bid pay up to get and keep the workers they need to meet the strong macroeconomic demand — and this dynamic is especially evident for low-wage workers. Their weekly pay, inflation adjusted, is up a whopping 5 percent over the past year. Woohoo!But if we look not at their trend but at their levels, we find that this low-paid, full-time worker still only earns around $24,000 per year. Refundable tax credits, like the Earned Income Tax Credit, can add close to $3,000 to that income (assuming a single parent with one kid), which helps a lot, but in virtually any city across the U.S., trying to get by on that salary is a recipe for persistent stress. Not woohoo.So, no question, higher pay is necessary to improve not just the quality of jobs, but the quality of life, for those in the bottom half of the pay scale. But, again, it’s the non-wage factors that make the Gallup report so interesting.According to Gallup’s chief economist, Jonathan Rothwell, even more predictive of job quality than income or benefits is the extent of engagement someone has in the workplace. Workers care a great deal whether their opinions are taken seriously, whether their development is encouraged, whether they have a chance to learn new skills that might lead to upward mobility. Conversely, being stuck in a repetitive, uncreative position erodes job quality.Okay, but aren’t some jobs just inevitably lousy? Yes, in terms of some of the quality killers just noted, but it’s a total cop-out — not to mention inefficient — for employers to throw their hands up in despair. Benefits such as health and child care are too rare in low-wage jobs, and they make a bad job better. Same with a sense of control over scheduling. And creative employers find ways to engage their workers by, for example, seeking their input on issues of satisfaction, safety, customer service, scheduling and production processes.In fact, other compelling research finds, again unsurprisingly, that an engaged worker is a more productive worker: “Employee engagement consistently affects key performance outcomes, regardless of the organization’s industry or company.” Bottom line, job quantity — enough jobs for all those seeking work — is essential, but it isn’t the whole story. It’s necessary, but insufficient to achieve fair outcomes that uplift not just people’s living standards but also their spirits. So, the next time you hear some policymaker bragging about jobs, jobs, jobs, remember to ask her: What kind of jobs are we talking about?",job quantity check job quality check problem facing current u labor market job quantity ’ job quality record-length expansion u employer created million private-sector job pace percent per year providing another reminder myth job-killing robot historically ’ healthy rate unemployment -year low percent cared wa number job ’ little complain least aggregate level course place job gain much le impressive also care quality job raise question ’ good job thankfully new gallup survey provides uniquely deep dive question dive detail let ’ get two top-line observation way first wage matter far thing matter second even today ’ strong job market minority american percent report good job study defines good job along variety dimension beyond compensation pay benefit including whether pay hour work stable predictable control hour scheduling also important many worker ’ leave workplace even care sick child without docked pay worse sense purpose work career advancement opportunity power change thing ’ working round definition based worker ’ subjective response along line percent good job percent mediocre job percent bad job share varied way predictable surprising among lowest income worker percent bad job compared percent top income scale twice share african american worker bad job compared white worker percent v percent black woman particularly likely hold bad job percent gradient job quality education le steep might expect among graduate four-year college percent good job compared percent high school grad one sobering finding worst outcome job quality education worker started ’ finish college presumably people stuck college debt ’ get earning power bestowed college degree unsurprisingly worker differ little term value work differ income level whether job actually give example ’ important percent low- high-income worker alike pay stable predictable bill rent mortgage payment gas child care college tuition like generally stable predictable percent high-income worker satisfied predictability pay percent low-income worker share sense satisfaction critical insight usually miss way u look wage trend applaud good reason increase pay pay little attention wage level question positive trend move low-wage worker right direction data bureau labor statistic provides excellent example ’ talking thanks tight job market employer bid pay get keep worker need meet strong macroeconomic demand dynamic especially evident low-wage worker weekly pay inflation adjusted whopping percent past year woohoo ! look trend level find low-paid full-time worker still earns around $ per year refundable tax credit like earned income tax credit add close $ income assuming single parent one kid help lot virtually city across u trying get salary recipe persistent stress woohoo question higher pay necessary improve quality job quality life bottom half pay scale ’ non-wage factor make gallup report interesting according gallup ’ chief economist jonathan rothwell even predictive job quality income benefit extent engagement someone ha workplace worker care great deal whether opinion taken seriously whether development encouraged whether chance learn new skill might lead upward mobility conversely stuck repetitive uncreative position erodes job quality okay ’ job inevitably lousy yes term quality killer noted ’ total cop-out mention inefficient employer throw hand despair benefit health child care rare low-wage job make bad job better sense control scheduling creative employer find way engage worker example seeking input issue satisfaction safety customer service scheduling production process fact compelling research find unsurprisingly engaged worker productive worker “ employee engagement consistently affect key performance outcome regardless organization ’ industry company ” bottom line job quantity enough job seeking work essential ’ whole story ’ necessary insufficient achieve fair outcome uplift people ’ living standard also spirit next time hear policymaker bragging job job job remember ask kind job talking ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/10/28/job-quantity-check-job-quality-not-check/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
"How Silicon Valley breeds boredom, loneliness and vanity",2019-10-28,PostEverything,"We are glued to our smartphones for many reasons — to stay in touch with friends and family, to take photos and to read the news while waiting for the bus. With so many benefits come costs: Our phones distract us at work and while driving, at the dinner table and during life’s quiet moments, so that even simple pleasures like watching a sunset become fodder for Instagram photos or tweets.This assault on our attention has become so common that new technologies and routines have arisen to combat it. But features designed to police screen times, set time limits on app usage and schedule “wind down time,” which turns screens to grayscale before bedtime, are not enough. Nor are the periodic digital Sabbaths and detoxes, which many undertake to be free of their phones.To properly combat the million-dollar engineering that Silicon Valley deploys to hijack our attention, we need to recognize that technologies have long affected Americans’ behaviors and feelings. Well before smartphones, new inventions shaped our culture and our emotions, and changed how we feel about vanity, loneliness and boredom. Today, Silicon Valley is the latest to exploit these feelings in an effort to keep us harnessed to our screens.For centuries, moralists preached that pride and vanity are deadly sins. Humans shouldn’t boast or think too much of themselves because they are fallible. Likewise, Americans were taught to regard their accomplishments as hollow and fleeting because life is short. But popular technologies of the 19th century challenged these mores and helped inculcate new ones.After photography was introduced to the United States in 1839, it took off quickly, and Americans flocked to photographers’ studios. Photos were relatively inexpensive: by mid-century, very small photos were available for as little as 25 cents — about $8 in 2019. Suddenly, having a portrait of oneself — long the privilege of elites — was possible for a wide swath of the American population. Frederick Douglass celebrated this shift when he observed that “the humblest servant girl, whose income is but a few shillings per week” could now have “a more perfect likeness of herself than noble ladies and even royalty … fifty years ago.”The spread of mass-produced mirrors in the late 19th century had a similar effect, enabling rich and poor alike to study their images, and try to perfect them.More than just allowing people to display themselves, these technologies helped to alter attitudes about self-presentation and self-promotion. They trained Americans to focus on themselves, perfect their images and present themselves to others in words and pictures. What’s more, they increased the pressure on Americans to publicly celebrate their appearances and accomplishments.By the 1930s, editorialists were declaring that “Vanity is Sanity,” for well-adjusted individuals should care about their image and try to look their best. Lack of interest in one’s appearance signaled psychological problems. Whereas vanity had once been a sin, it now became a requirement for social success.If Americans were learning to stop worrying about appearing too vain and embrace their own reflections, they were also embracing new attitudes about loneliness.Our 19th-century forebears were resigned to the fact that they would sometimes be alone. Unitarian minister William Rounseville Alger wrote in 1867, “There is more loneliness in life than there is communion. The solitudes of the world out-measure its societies.” Enslaved African Americans expressed similar sentiments in the spiritual “Lonesome Valley,” with its lyrics, “You gotta walk that Lonesome Valley; you gotta go there by yourself …” Being lonely wasn’t pleasurable, but it wasn’t surprising or particularly worrisome, either. And like Henry David Thoreau, many even celebrated it, recasting it as solitude, and arguing it could bring revelation and prove redemptive.Over the course of the 20th century, however, Americans gradually pathologized the experience of being alone. Capitalizing on and amplifying this negative view of aloneness, technology companies promised consumers that if they purchased telephones, radios and phonographs, they need never feel lonesome again.In the 1940s, the word “loner” emerged as a pejorative description for those on their own. Meanwhile, the term “solitude” fell out of favor while the word “loneliness” came into wider use, reflecting a growing consensus that there was something wrong and even shameful about being alone. In an age when telecommunications networks were spreading across the globe, and cheerful sociability was becoming a new emotional norm, choosing to disconnect and embrace more solitary ways began to carry a stigma.Radios and phonographs, likewise, came to fill the silences in American homes, creating a sense of companionship at all times. These new technologies also sought to assuage a new condition of modern life: boredom.Before the mid-19th century Americans never experienced boredom, for the word didn't exist in English. While monotony was a recognized, expected part of life, Americans lacked a clear lexicon for worrying about it. And some even celebrated it — like William Channing Gannett in his popular 1890 book “Blessed Be Drudgery.”However, after the word “boredom” was coined, it spread, and during the late 19th century, it was increasingly used to describe the inner experience of empty moments. By the mid-20th century, psychologists were suggesting that boredom is a measurable problem and that individuals are entitled to diversion in daily life, a message which movie studios, radio producers, television tycoons and merchants eagerly took up. A 1938 ad for the motion picture industry told readers that movie theaters provided a “happy haven” where “millions may confidently come for freedom from boredom and car,” while a 1945 Kellogg’s ad claimed its variety pack would “banish breakfast boredom.” These industries branded boredom as anathema to living a good life and Americans soon began to regard it as a dangerous emotion that ought to be stamped out as quickly as possible.What is clear from our vantage point today is that the people who were pushing photography, telephones, radios, movies and other consumer goods did so by exploiting shifting mores around vanity, loneliness and boredom. But they also exacerbated them, reinforcing the belief that people should present their best faces to the world and the conviction that they should always be in contact, and never be bored or unstimulated.In turn, these ideas have become central to our daily lives. We harbor fewer reservations about vanity than our ancestors. We turn to our phones because we have become accustomed to celebrating ourselves and to seek out the affirmation of others. We are also obsessed with our phones because so many of us regard loneliness and boredom as pathologies with potentially negative consequences for our health. As a result, these emotions are now considered feelings to be cured rather than endured. Anxious about being alone and worried about being bored, we use our phones to seek out constant companionship and unending entertainment.To put down our phones, or at least to use them more wisely, we should be attendant to this history and how Silicon Valley exploits its legacy. We take up social media’s invitation to post selfies and indulge our vanities because we’re conditioned by history to do so. Conversely, because we worry more about loneliness and boredom than our ancestors did, we’re more apt to turn to our phones since they promise to relieve these afflictions.There is no going back. But in rescuing our attention from companies determined to wrest it from us, it’s important to remember that the vulnerabilities Silicon Valley exploits are far from inevitable and are, instead, a result of culture and history. The way our culture trains us to experience vanity, loneliness and boredom can be changed. We can shift our thinking to recognize the value of humility, of solitude and of empty moments. Doing so may help us master rather than be mastered by our phones.",silicon valley breed boredom loneliness vanity glued smartphones many reason stay touch friend family take photo read news waiting

"Pentagon awards controversial $10 billion cloud computing deal to Microsoft, spurning Amazon",2019-10-28,Technology,"The Pentagon awarded its controversial $10 billion cloud computing business to Microsoft on Friday evening, spurning a bid from Amazon, which had been expected to win the contract. President Trump had expressed opposition to giving the lucrative award to a company led by Jeff Bezos, a regular target of his ire.The announcement came after an intense lobbying effort and a lawsuit filed by some of America’s biggest tech companies, which accused the military of favoring Amazon in a process that has dragged on for more than a year. During that time, Trump and other administration officials made it clear they did not want the contract to go to Amazon. Federal acquisition laws forbid politicians, including the president, from influencing contract awards.Amazon Web Services, or AWS, pioneered the lucrative cloud computing business more than a decade ago and holds a leading 48 percent market share, according to market-research firm Gartner. Microsoft is the second-largest with a 15.5 percent share.Defense Secretary Mark Esper recuses himself from massive Pentagon contract, citing son’s employmentThe cloud computing contract, Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, is not only the military’s largest information technology contract award in history, but it also is expected to lead to other business across the federal government. Amazon was openly described by competitors and industry analysts as a clear front-runner because of its years of experience handling classified data for the CIA. The military also gave the company its highest data management certification. Microsoft’s designation was one step below Amazon’s.Few thought Microsoft would beat out Amazon for the massive contract, and legal analysts said the president’s role in the procurement will almost certainly become the subject of litigation.“It’s crystal clear here that the President of the United States did not want this contract to be awarded to one of the competitors,” said Franklin Turner, an attorney with the law firm McCarter & English. “As a result it’s fairly likely that we will see a number of challenges that the procurement was not conducted on a level playing field.”“Microsoft should expect a near-term war here,” Turner said. “It’s a virtual guarantee that Amazon is going to pull out all the stops to check the government’s math on this one.”After Trump cites Amazon concerns, Pentagon reexamines $10 billion JEDI cloud contract processIn a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.”All parties, the statement said, “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria.”“We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.”Microsoft spokesman Frank X. Shaw declined to comment. The company had initially been opposed to the idea of awarding such a massive contract to a single company, arguing that such an approach would hamper innovation. “We believe the best approach is one that leverages the innovations of multiple cloud service providers,” the company said early last year.Defense inspector general to investigate Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contractThe JEDI contract is the Defense Department’s approach to address the outdated patchwork of computer systems that are frequently specific to an agency. U.S. military officials said earlier this year that the current disjointed approach has hindered the sharing of intelligence and made it difficult for military agencies to adopt artificial intelligence technology.Rival nations, meanwhile, are investing deeply in those capabilities.The contract calls for the military to use a technical infrastructure, known as cloud computing, where customers rent services from companies such as Amazon and Microsoft, rather than purchasing the hardware and software to operate in their own data centers. The design of the technology allows customers to tap into massive farms of servers as they need to. And because the tech giants manage the technology, it runs the latest version of software and is thought to have the highest level of security.Trump has openly spoken out against Amazon and its chief executive. He has attacked the Bezos-owned Washington Post for its coverage of him by conflating it with Amazon’s interests. The president has called the news organization the “Amazon Washington Post” while accusing it of publishing “fake news” and being a “lobbyist newspaper” for the company.Retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who worked for former defense secretary Jim Mattis, alleged in a recently published book that Trump sought to “screw” Amazon by locking it out of the JEDI contract and that the secretary refused to do so.Soon after the Pentagon announced early last year that it would award the contract to a single tech company, a group of Amazon competitors that then included Microsoft, Oracle and IBM launched a highly public lobbying campaign seeking to break the award up into multiple pieces. The Pentagon has refused to budge from its initial strategy for the JEDI contract. In April of last year, Oracle co-chief executive Safra Catz brought it up in a dinner with Trump.The Pentagon’s cloud strategy to catch up to the commercial tech industryMore recently, the campaign against the single-award approach has been led by Oracle. The company’s policy organization created a colorful one-page flow chart that featured photographs of Amazon executives, as well as other defense officials in charge of the procurement, including Mattis, with the title “A Conspiracy To Create A Ten Year DoD Cloud Monopoly.” The graphic, which was labeled “most wanted,” later landed on Trump’s desk, people familiar with the matter said at the time.In a news conference in July, Trump said he had asked aides to investigate the JEDI contract because he had received complaints from Amazon’s competitors.“I’m getting tremendous complaints about the contract with the Pentagon and with Amazon. … They’re saying it wasn’t competitively bid,” Trump said. “Some of the greatest companies in the world are complaining about it, having to do with Amazon and the Department of Defense, and I will be asking them to look at it very closely to see what’s going on.”The president said he had heard complaints from “companies like Microsoft, Oracle and IBM,” each of which were initial bidders along with Amazon.Soon after, he retweeted a link to a Fox News segment that referred to the JEDI contract as the “Bezos bailout.”That same month — after a lawsuit and bid protests against the JEDI contract from Oracle and IBM were dismissed — the deal appeared to be headed in Amazon’s favor.Trump says Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contract should be investigated. Again.But the White House in late July instructed Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper to reexamine the awarding of JEDI because of concerns that the deal would go to Amazon, officials close to the decision-making process told The Washington Post. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity to talk freely about the private conversations.In an interview with The Washington Post then, Esper acknowledged he had heard from “folks in the administration” about JEDI.“I’m going to take a hard look at it,” he said. “We’re not going to be making any decisions soon until I’m comfortable with where it is and … then we’ll look at what adjustments we need to make, if any.”Esper recused himself from the JEDI procurement process earlier this week, citing a conflict of interest. An IBM spokeswoman told The Post that Esper’s son, Luke, “has been a digital strategy consultant with IBM Services since February. His role is unrelated to IBM’s pursuit of JEDI.”A person familiar with Amazon’s thinking said the company is “evaluating options” with regard to protesting the award. If Amazon filed a protest, the company would first need to raise concerns with the Government Accountability Office. If that agency ruled that the Defense Department award was justified, Amazon could then appeal the matter to the Court of Federal Claims.Amazon this year chose to build a massive second headquarters a few miles from the Pentagon’s campus.The maximum value of the contract is $10 billion over a 10-year period, although only $1 billion in funding was obligated for it at the time of the award. Defense officials have also emphasized that they are not “locked in” to the 10-year time frame, as they could cut the project short by declining to exercise certain contract options later on.“Clearly,

AD–SAP–Experience Management is Here,2019-10-28,Technology,"The Pentagon awarded its controversial $10 billion cloud computing business to Microsoft on Friday evening, spurning a bid from Amazon, which had been expected to win the contract. President Trump had expressed opposition to giving the lucrative award to a company led by Jeff Bezos, a regular target of his ire.The announcement came after an intense lobbying effort and a lawsuit filed by some of America’s biggest tech companies, which accused the military of favoring Amazon in a process that has dragged on for more than a year. During that time, Trump and other administration officials made it clear they did not want the contract to go to Amazon. Federal acquisition laws forbid politicians, including the president, from influencing contract awards.Amazon Web Services, or AWS, pioneered the lucrative cloud computing business more than a decade ago and holds a leading 48 percent market share, according to market-research firm Gartner. Microsoft is the second-largest with a 15.5 percent share.Defense Secretary Mark Esper recuses himself from massive Pentagon contract, citing son’s employmentThe cloud computing contract, Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure, known as JEDI, is not only the military’s largest information technology contract award in history, but it also is expected to lead to other business across the federal government. Amazon was openly described by competitors and industry analysts as a clear front-runner because of its years of experience handling classified data for the CIA. The military also gave the company its highest data management certification. Microsoft’s designation was one step below Amazon’s.Few thought Microsoft would beat out Amazon for the massive contract, and legal analysts said the president’s role in the procurement will almost certainly become the subject of litigation.“It’s crystal clear here that the President of the United States did not want this contract to be awarded to one of the competitors,” said Franklin Turner, an attorney with the law firm McCarter & English. “As a result it’s fairly likely that we will see a number of challenges that the procurement was not conducted on a level playing field.”“Microsoft should expect a near-term war here,” Turner said. “It’s a virtual guarantee that Amazon is going to pull out all the stops to check the government’s math on this one.”After Trump cites Amazon concerns, Pentagon reexamines $10 billion JEDI cloud contract processIn a statement announcing the award, the Defense Department said: “The acquisition process was conducted in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.”All parties, the statement said, “were treated fairly and evaluated consistently with the solicitation’s stated evaluation criteria.”“We’re surprised about this conclusion,” Amazon spokesman Drew Herdener said in a statement. “AWS is the clear leader in cloud computing, and a detailed assessment purely on the comparative offerings clearly lead to a different conclusion.”Microsoft spokesman Frank X. Shaw declined to comment. The company had initially been opposed to the idea of awarding such a massive contract to a single company, arguing that such an approach would hamper innovation. “We believe the best approach is one that leverages the innovations of multiple cloud service providers,” the company said early last year.Defense inspector general to investigate Pentagon’s $10 billion cloud contractThe JEDI contract is the Defense Department’s approach to address the outdated patchwork of computer systems that are frequently specific to an agency. U.S. military officials said earlier this year that the current disjointed approach has hindered the sharing of intelligence and made it difficult for military agencies to adopt artificial intelligence technology.Rival nations, meanwhile, are investing deeply in those capabilities.The contract calls for the military to use a technical infrastructure, known as cloud computing, where customers rent services from companies such as Amazon and Microsoft, rather than purchasing the hardware and software to operate in their own data centers. The design of the technology allows customers to tap into massive farms of servers as they need to. And because the tech giants manage the technology, it runs the latest version of software and is thought to have the highest level of security.Trump has openly spoken out against Amazon and its chief executive. He has attacked the Bezos-owned Washington Post for its coverage of him by conflating it with Amazon’s interests. The president has called the news organization the “Amazon Washington Post” while accusing it of publishing “fake news” and being a “lobbyist newspaper” for the company.Retired Navy commander Guy Snodgrass, who worked for former defense secretary Jim Mattis, alleged in a recently published book that Trump sought to “screw” Amazon by locking it out of the JEDI contract and that the secretary refused to do so.Soon after the Pentagon announced early last year that it would award the contract to a single tech company, a group of Amazon competitors that then included Microsoft, Oracle and IBM launched a highly public lobbying campaign seeking to break the award up into multiple pieces.

Google’s newest phone is literally just a piece of paper,2019-10-28,Technology,"You can’t take a selfie on Google’s newest phone. It doesn’t even make calls.It’s just a piece of paper, printed with a few pieces of information at home and folded into a rectangle. With a few snips of a scissors, it can hold a credit card.The Paper Phone is part of a new package of “digital well-being experiments” that the company says is aimed at giving users a “digital detox.” It arrived the same week Google launched its latest phone: the $800 Pixel 4, which has built-in radar technology that can be controlled by a user’s hand motions.How much screen time? Silicon Valley parents are still trying to figure it out.Google’s Paper Phone is the latest in a string of offerings attempting to grab the attention of an audience weary of the ever-expanding presence of tech in our lives, as well as the feeling of being chained to your phone.Wellness advocates suggest putting your phone in the other room while you sleep. There’s a movement toward “No-Tech Sundays,” where participants abandon their tech for the day. Resorts, start-ups and wellness gurus are cashing in on the unplugged travel trend with a variety of digital detox events.There is even a “National Day of Unplugging.” The Paper Phone project is one of Google’s open-source experiments that also includes a phone wallpaper that counts how many times a day a user unlocks their device, and a “desert island” program that gives users access to only their most essential apps for 24 hours.“We hope these experiments inspire developers and designers to keep digital well-being top of mind when building technology,” Google Creative Lab team lead Emma Turpin wrote in a blog post Wednesday.Teens find circumventing Apple’s parental controls is child’s playSome of the movement to unplug stems from research around the effects of tech on our health. The World Health Organization released new screen time guidelines for parents earlier this year based on research that found behavioral and developmental issues in children who spent hours in front of a screen. Other research has found connections between smartphone usage and anxiety.Tanya Goodin, a London-based digital well-being evangelist, says Google’s project reminds her of when Big Tobacco targeted consumers concerned about their health with low-tar cigarettes to keep them as customers.“Instead of children’s games, they have to look seriously at the fact that we’ve been rats in this big Silicon Valley experiment,” said Goodin. “The fact that we can’t disengage from technology is exactly because of the things these companies have been doing for years.” Former Google design ethicist Tristan Harris launched a tech ethics nonprofit originally called Time Well Spent and now known as the Center for Humane Technology. Harris has argued that the tech industry is engaged in a “race to the bottom of the brain stem,” and that tech design should enhance — not endanger — humanity. The “time well spent” concept has been widely referenced by Silicon Valley executives, including Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg.Zuckerberg said at a company event Friday that he has told his team to optimize meaningful interactions between users on the platform, rather than maximizing spending time on it, according to a tweet from Flipboard editor Ken Yeung.Zuckerberg said that he’s prohibited the Facebook Feed team from optimizing the feed to maximize time spent. Instead, it’s about facilitating meaningful interactions. Says it’s one of the most misunderstood things Facebook does.Your digital detox isn’t as radical as you thinkPaper Phone isn’t Google’s first attempt at using paper products to explore the digital world. In 2014, the company introduced Google Cardboard, a way to view virtual reality applications on a smartphone. Google said it shipped 5 million pairs of the low-tech glasses in 19 months. Anthony Martinez, a cyber-navigator at the Chicago Public Library, tweeted his approval of Google’s most recent foray into the two-dimensional world.“I’m all about minimalism and this is fantastic and feels like an art project in just the right way,” he said.I'm all about minimalism and this is fantastic and feels like an art project in just the right way. #PaperPhone #DigitalDetox #miminalism https://t.co/5qlVyWVNLn",google ’ newest phone literally piece paper ’ take selfie google ’ newest phone ’ even make call ’ piece paper printed piece information home folded rectangle snip scissors hold credit card paper phone part new package “ digital well-being experiment ” company say aimed giving user “ digital detox ” arrived week google launched latest phone $ pixel ha built-in radar technology controlled user ’ hand motion much screen time silicon valley parent still trying figure google ’ paper phone latest string offering attempting grab attention audience weary ever-expanding presence tech life well feeling chained phone wellness advocate suggest putting phone room sleep ’ movement toward “ no-tech sunday ” participant abandon tech day resort start-ups wellness guru cashing unplugged travel trend variety digital detox event even “ national day unplugging ” paper phone project one google ’ open-source experiment also includes phone wallpaper count many time day user unlocks device “ desert island ” program give user access essential apps hour “ hope experiment inspire developer designer keep digital well-being top mind building technology ” google creative lab team lead emma turpin wrote blog post wednesday teen find circumventing apple ’ parental control child ’ playsome movement unplug stem research around effect tech health world health organization released new screen time guideline parent earlier year based research found behavioral developmental issue child spent hour front screen research ha found connection smartphone usage anxiety tanya goodin london-based digital well-being evangelist say google ’ project reminds big tobacco targeted consumer concerned health low-tar cigarette keep customer “ instead child ’ game look seriously fact ’ rat big silicon valley experiment ” said goodin “ fact ’ disengage technology exactly thing company year ” former google design ethicist tristan harris launched tech ethic nonprofit originally called time well spent known center humane technology harris ha argued tech industry engaged “ race bottom brain stem ” tech design enhance endanger humanity “ time well spent ” concept ha widely referenced silicon valley executive including facebook ceo mark zuckerberg zuckerberg said company event friday ha told team optimize meaningful interaction user platform rather maximizing spending time according tweet flipboard editor ken yeung zuckerberg said ’ prohibited facebook feed team optimizing feed maximize time spent instead ’ facilitating meaningful interaction say ’ one misunderstood thing facebook doe digital detox ’ radical thinkpaper phone ’ google ’ first attempt using paper product explore digital world company introduced google cardboard way view virtual reality application smartphone google said shipped million pair low-tech glass month anthony martinez cyber-navigator chicago public library tweeted approval google ’ recent foray two-dimensional world “ ’ minimalism fantastic feel like art project right way ” said minimalism fantastic feel like art project right way # paperphone # digitaldetox # miminalism http co qlvywvnln ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/10/28/googles-newest-phone-is-literally-just-piece-paper/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
To the NYSE and beyond: Virgin Galactic becomes first public space tourism company,2019-10-28,Business & Real Estate,"Virgin Galactic stock popped in its New York Stock Exchange debut Monday, with shares rising more than 9 percent as investors welcomed the first publicly traded space tourism company. The Richard Branson company merged last week with Social Capital Hedosophia, a New York investment firm already listed on the NYSE, allowing Virgin Galactic to bypass the standard stock offering process. Social Capital Hedosophia took a 46.5 percent stake, giving Virgin Galactic a valuation of about $1.5 billion.Initially priced at $12 a share, Virgin Galactic stock was trading around $13.50 a share by mid-morning. “Virgin Galactic is making history again today as it becomes the world’s first and only publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company,” chief executive George Whitesides said in a statement. “For the first time, anyone will have the opportunity to invest in a human spaceflight company that is transforming the market.”The public debut of Virgin Galactic — which takes the SPCE ticker — is a major milestone for the fast-growing space sector, which is projected to be worth $2.7 trillion by 2045, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. For years, Virgin Galactic has been locked in competition with fellow billionaire-led enterprises, such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin. Bezos has said Blue Origin is vying to build a lunar lander for NASA, as it aims to return astronauts to the moon by 2024. (Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)Virgin Galactic was founded in 2004, but it suffered serious setbacks after a spaceship came apart during a test flight over the Mojave Desert in 2014, killing co-pilot Michael Alsbury. The company has raised more than $1 billion since its inception, but much of it came directly from Branson, a British billionaire. Boeing recently invested $20 million for a 1 percent stake in the company, which said its first commercial flights will commence in mid-2020.With the capital it raises by going public, Virgin Galactic said it will be able to sustain its operations until it begins commercial flights and starts generating its own revenue. The company estimates it will carry more than 1,500 tourists a year by 2023, according to a regulatory filing, and generate close to $600 million in revenue.So far, Virgin has flown its vehicle SpaceShipTwo to the edge of space twice. The first flight, in December, was with two test pilots. The second, in February, had two pilots and a crew member. The five members of the flights were awarded commercial astronaut wings by the Federal Aviation Administration.More than 600 people in 60 countries — including pop star Justin Bieber — have put down more than $80 million in deposits to join Virgin Galactic’s reservation list; that’s $250,000 a ticket. The company’s customer backlog alone would double the number of people who have ever gone to space. Earlier this month, it unveiled the sleek spacesuits Under Armour built for its passengers.“With our proprietary spaceflight system, special airspace access at Spaceport America, globally-recognized brand and broad investor interest, we believe Virgin Galactic is ideally positioned to capitalize on the fast-growing, multibillion-dollar commercial space market and ultimately open space to thousands of new astronauts,” Branson said before trading began Monday, according to a statement.Unlike a traditional rocket that launches vertically, Virgin Galactic has built a spaceplane that is tethered to the bellow of a carrier airplane, which hoists it to an altitude of about 40,000 feet. There, the spaceplane is released, fires its motor and races through the atmosphere to the edge of space, where passengers would spend about four minutes in a weightless environment.The company is still transitioning from test facilities to its permanent home in rural New Mexico: Spaceport America, the “world’s first purpose-built commercial spaceport,” which cost New Mexico taxpayers $220 million to build.",nyse beyond virgin galactic becomes first public space tourism company virgin galactic stock popped new york stock exchange debut monday share rising percent investor welcomed first publicly traded space tourism company richard branson company merged last week social capital hedosophia new york investment firm already listed nyse allowing virgin galactic bypass standard stock offering process social capital hedosophia took percent stake giving virgin galactic valuation $ billion initially priced $ share virgin galactic stock wa trading around $ share mid-morning “ virgin galactic making history today becomes world ’ first publicly traded commercial human spaceflight company ” chief executive george whitesides said statement “ first time anyone opportunity invest human spaceflight company transforming market ” public debut virgin galactic take spce ticker major milestone fast-growing space sector projected worth $ trillion according bank america merrill lynch year virgin galactic ha locked competition fellow billionaire-led enterprise elon musk ’ spacex jeff bezos ’ blue origin bezos ha said blue origin vying build lunar lander nasa aim return astronaut moon bezos founder chief executive amazon owns washington post virgin galactic wa founded suffered serious setback spaceship came apart test flight mojave desert killing co-pilot michael alsbury company ha raised $ billion since inception much came directly branson british billionaire boeing recently invested $ million percent stake company said first commercial flight commence mid- capital raise going public virgin galactic said able sustain operation begin commercial flight start generating revenue company estimate carry tourist year according regulatory filing generate close $ million revenue far virgin ha flown vehicle spaceshiptwo edge space twice first flight december wa two test pilot second february two pilot crew member five member flight awarded commercial astronaut wing federal aviation administration people country including pop star justin bieber put $ million deposit join virgin galactic ’ reservation list ’ $ ticket company ’ customer backlog alone would double number people ever gone space earlier month unveiled sleek spacesuit armour built passenger “ proprietary spaceflight system special airspace access spaceport america globally-recognized brand broad investor interest believe virgin galactic ideally positioned capitalize fast-growing multibillion-dollar commercial space market ultimately open space thousand new astronaut ” branson said trading began monday according statement unlike traditional rocket launch vertically virgin galactic ha built spaceplane tethered bellow carrier airplane hoist altitude foot spaceplane released fire motor race atmosphere edge space passenger would spend four minute weightless environment company still transitioning test facility permanent home rural new mexico spaceport america “ world ’ first purpose-built commercial spaceport ” cost new mexico taxpayer $ million build ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/28/virgin-galactic-takes-space-tourism-public-with-historic-nyse-listing/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
Here’s why Halloween is the deadliest day of the year for child pedestrians,2019-10-28,Business & Real Estate,"It’s almost Halloween, which means that law enforcement agencies around the country are warning parents about the possibility of finding marijuana candy in their children’s trick-or-treat buckets.But like poison and razor blades, Halloween pot candy is largely a myth. The real threat to kids on Oct. 31 is much more mundane: traffic. Children are three times more likely to be struck and killed by a car on the holiday than any other day of the year, according to the latest federal highway safety data.A Washington Post analysis found that 54 pedestrians younger than 18 were struck and killed by an automobile on Halloween from 2004 through 2018. That compares with 16 on a typical day.In absolute terms, the likelihood of a child being killed by a car on Halloween is still extremely low, given the hundreds of millions of trick-or-treaters who went out during the time period analyzed. But the holiday nonetheless stands out sharply when charted against every other day.Roads have also become more dangerous for pedestrians in the past decade. In fact, more pedestrians and cyclists were fatally struck by cars in 2018 than any other year since 1990, federal highway authorities recently warned. Adjusting for total vehicle miles traveled, the rate of pedestrian fatalities has increased by 33 percent since 2009. Pedestrians now account for 17 percent of all traffic deaths.Experts say these numbers are influenced, in part, by the growing number of people biking and walking to work, as well as deficiencies in public policy and city planning. For decades, roadways have been designed with driver safety in mind, rather than walkers or cyclists.Those safety deficiencies are most obvious on Halloween, a day when millions of additional pedestrians take to the streets during the twilight hours, historically the most dangerous time of day for pedestrians. The majority of those trick-or-treaters are children, the smallest of whom can be harder for drivers to spot from the windows of SUVs.A study released earlier this year in JAMA Pediatrics found that children ages 4 to 8 were about 10 times more likely to be killed in the evening on Halloween than they were during other autumn evenings. The study found that the 6 p.m. hour — a confluence of rush hour and sunset in many parts of the country — was the deadliest time for trick-or-treaters to be on the road.While Halloween safety tips tend to focus on the behavior of individual trick-or-treaters, the authors of the JAMA Pediatrics study emphasize instead the importance of better highway policy and construction. Halloween pedestrian deaths “highlight deficiencies of the built environment (e.g., lack of sidewalks, unsafe street crossings), shortcomings in public policy (e.g., insufficient space for play), and failures in traffic control (e.g., excessive speed),” they write.Rather than focus on Halloween-specific safety recommendations, such as the use of reflective tape on costumes, the researchers write that “year-round application of effective traffic safety interventions will foster much greater progress toward eliminating pedestrian fatalities altogether.”",’ halloween deadliest day year child pedestrian ’ almost halloween mean law enforcement agency around country warning parent possibility finding marijuana candy child ’ trick-or-treat bucket like poison razor blade halloween pot candy largely myth real threat kid oct much mundane traffic child three time likely struck killed car holiday day year according latest federal highway safety data washington post analysis found pedestrian younger struck killed automobile halloween compare typical day absolute term likelihood child killed car halloween still extremely low given hundred million trick-or-treaters went time period analyzed holiday nonetheless stand sharply charted every day road also become dangerous pedestrian past decade fact pedestrian cyclist fatally struck car year since federal highway authority recently warned adjusting total vehicle mile traveled rate pedestrian fatality ha increased percent since pedestrian account percent traffic death expert say number influenced part growing number people biking walking work well deficiency public policy city planning decade roadway designed driver safety mind rather walker cyclist safety deficiency obvious halloween day million additional pedestrian take street twilight hour historically dangerous time day pedestrian majority trick-or-treaters child smallest harder driver spot window suv study released earlier year jama pediatrics found child age time likely killed evening halloween autumn evening study found p hour confluence rush hour sunset many part country wa deadliest time trick-or-treaters road halloween safety tip tend focus behavior individual trick-or-treaters author jama pediatrics study emphasize instead importance better highway policy construction halloween pedestrian death “ highlight deficiency built environment e g lack sidewalk unsafe street crossing shortcoming public policy e g insufficient space play failure traffic control e g excessive speed ” write rather focus halloween-specific safety recommendation use reflective tape costume researcher write “ year-round application effective traffic safety intervention foster much greater progress toward eliminating pedestrian fatality altogether ” ,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/10/28/heres-why-halloween-is-deadliest-day-year-child-pedestrians/,2019-10-28,Washington Post
This might surprise you. Seniors are not more susceptible to scams; younger adults are.,2019-10-28,Business & Real Estate,"When you think of a victim of financial fraud, you probably imagine an aging woman or man home alone, giving out their credit card information to a stranger on the phone.But according to a new report from the Federal Trade Commission, in 2018, people 60 and older were 20 percent less likely than younger adults to report losing money to fraud.However, when seniors fall victim to a scam, their losses were higher. People 80 and older lost the most, reporting a median individual loss of $1,700, which was more than four times the median losses of consumers in their 20s and 30s, and more than two to three times higher than in other age groups.The FTC collects and analyzes consumer report information through an online database called the Consumer Sentinel Network. Law enforcement agencies and other organizations contribute consumer reports to the database, which is searchable by criteria such as the type of fraud. Last year, consumers reported nearly 3.1 million cases of fraud, according to the FTC.Here are the median individual losses to fraud last year by age, according to the FTC report:Ages 20-29: $400Ages 30-39: $385Ages 40-49: $455Ages 50-59: $508Ages 60-69: $600Ages 70-79: $769Ages 80 and older: $1,700Seniors were scammed the most by tech support scams. Online fraud came in second. Older adults were 371 percent more likely to report losing money on this type of scam than younger consumers, the FTC said. The aggregate amount older consumers reported losing on tech support scams in 2018 was nearly $21 million.The FTC provides advice in this guide: How to Spot, Avoid and Report Tech Support Scams.Fraudsters are getting to older adults most often by calling them. In fact, seniors were four times more likely than other consumers to be contacted by phone.Read: Robocalls have these retirees afraid to answer their phones“This high rate of phone fraud reporting was driven largely by reported calls from government impostors, particularly Social Security Administration impostors,” the FTC report said. “In numerous instances, the scammers contacted the consumers daily, building relationships and creating trust. Frequently, large money losses occurred through multiple contacts over the course of weeks or months.” Read:This Social Security scam is just evilBeware of scammers who say it’s the government callingIn 2018, older adults most often reported paying fraudsters with a credit card, gift or reload card, or wire transfer, according to the FTC. But the number of older adults who said they paid with a gift or reloadable cards is on the rise. Read: Is ‘the IRS’ asking you to pay by gift card? It’s the latest ‘impostor’ scam.“During the course of 2018, the number of older adults who said they paid with gift cards or reload cards increased dramatically,” the FTC wrote in its report. “In fact, during the second half of 2018 (and continuing into 2019), gift and reload cards were the most frequently reported payment method by older adults, even for tech support scams. This is a concerning trend as gift and reload cards offer virtually no fraud protections for consumers. Credit cards offer the strongest fraud protections for consumers.” What’s particularly sad about victimizing seniors is how it leaves them feeling.“Many reported feeling a loss to their self-image as competent people with a lifetime of experience that would help them avoid being fooled,” the FTC said. “Some reported seeing this as proof that they were now too old to be handling their own money.” Your ThoughtsIf you were a victim of a scam, how have you dealt with the loss?

Do a checkup on your coverage.I invited readers to share their thoughts on the open enrollment process. Noreene Sweeney of Lancaster, Pa., wrote, “I spend many hours researching for myself, my husband and friends each year. For anyone comparing plans, I would say enter your drug(s), no matter how much you don’t want to do it. My husband takes 20 plus [medications] and I hate typing in all those names, dosages, etc. But the difference is incredible; just one of his drugs could cost us $50,000 per year without any insurance. I can find only one plan where the co-pay is reasonable (under $75 a month), so of course that’s the plan we will stick with. The formulary is everything, so do the homework and compare, compare, compare.” “I’m still in phase one of my review process,” wrote Angie Green of Clinton, Md. “So far, it annoys me in a major way that I cannot get access to the Medicare Plan Finder on my iPad. It opens the tab and then just stops there with a blank page. Medicare should provide a solution to this problem so that those of us with [older] devices can get access.” Robert Guth of Goshen, Ind., doesn’t like the new Medicare Part D comparison tool. “There are two reasons,” he said. “One, I am unable to rank plans by total costs, just by monthly premium or by drug charts. Total cost is the sum of the two and must both be considered. Two, the drug costs are not accurate. I entered some Tier 1 and Tier 2 drugs, and the standard drugstore cost is provided, but the preferred drugstore price is not used, so the cheapest plan is not correct if I plan to use a preferred store. My cheapest plan was several plans lower on the list, which I determined by comparing the actual formulary and the statement of changes. I am a retired health actuary, so I have enough experience to calculate this carefully.” Last week, one reader suggested laminating your Medicare card to protect it from wear and tear. But others pointed out that Medicare discourages lamination of your card. I could not find any such warning on the official Medicare.gov website; however, the Social Security Administration discourages people from laminating their Social Security card because it prevents detection of many security features.Here’s a suggestion from one reader to protect your paper Medicare card. “I got 10 plastic credit card size sleeves for $6 online that work perfectly,” Karen wrote.At Medicare.gov, read: 5 things to know about your Medicare card, including how to replace it should it become damaged or lost.Subscribe and stay informedIf you’re viewing this post online, sign up to automatically receive Michelle Singletary’s newsletters right into your email box: “Your Retirement” on Mondays and “Personal Finance” on ThursdaysRead and share Michelle Singletary’s Color of Money Column on Wednesdays and Sundays in The Washington Post.

Trump administration considers blacklisting Chinese companies that repeatedly steal U.S. intellectual property,2019-10-28,Business & Real Estate,"Brian Harker froze when he opened the emailed photo from his sales representative. The image, he said, showed Harker’s Grip-Tite sockets for sale on the shelves of a Tractor Supply store, something Harker had never authorized.There was only one way Harker could fathom that his product was for sale at Tractor Supply without his knowledge: A Chinese company had gone around him. Harker is an American tool inventor based in South Bend, Ind. In 2013, he signed a deal with Chinese manufacturing giant Hangzhou GreatStar Industrial to make tools based on his designs, but GreatStar was not allowed to sell the products without Harker’s permission.Harker thought he a had devised a foolproof method to keep an eye on GreatStar by having one key part necessary to manufacture Grip-Tite wrenches and sockets made in India. Harker had to approve shipment of the part to China.American farmers are growing weary of Trump as trade war drags onBut when he saw the picture of his tool for sale at Tractor Supply, a U.S. farm supply retailer, he realized the plan had not worked. Harker sued GreatStar and the case was settled in 2017. Details of the settlement were not publicly disclosed, a common practice in patent infringement cases. GreatStar denies wrongdoing.President Trump insists China must strengthen its intellectual property protections, but Chinese leaders have been reluctant to go as far as Trump wants, a major sticking point in the 19-month trade fight between the world’s two biggest economies. The White House claims the “phase one” agreement reached this month includes Chinese concessions on IP, but no details have been released and Chinese officials have not confirmed anything related to IP.As Trump’s frustration grows that China won’t change many of its laws and practices, senior White House officials are looking at ways beyond tariffs to use U.S. laws to pressure China on IP.Peter Navarro, a top Trump adviser who has spent much of his career calling for an aggressive crackdown on trade with China, has looked at blacklisting Chinese companies that steal American IP from doing business in the United States, according to three people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.Navarro’s team has explored the possibility of blacklisting Chinese companies that violate numerous U.S. copyright and patent laws by placing them on the Commerce Department’s “entity list,” according to the people familiar with the matter, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak publicly.Getting on the list makes it difficult to operate in the United States without obtaining a special license. The entity list mainly includes companies that pose a military or terrorist threat to the United States, but the Trump administration has frequently argued that economic security is part of national security.In a brief interview, Navarro called it “fake news” that he was working on an executive order to blacklist more Chinese companies, but people familiar with the plan have seen versions of it in writing.‘My Peter’: Rising influence of controversial Trump trade adviser Navarro concerns his critics“This is not historically the way the entity list has been used. It’s a major expansion of its mandate,” said Eric Altbach, a former deputy assistant U.S. Trade Representative focused on China. “It would put the U.S. government in the position of having to make an assessment of IP claims without a particularly clear process to do it.” Intellectual property theft by China costs the U.S. economy up to $600 billion a year, according to a report last year by the U.S. Trade Representative. That figure includes everything from knockoff movies to cybertheft and China’s longtime requirement that U.S. firms partner with Chinese ones, a practice that often requires handing over business secrets to the Chinese. China introduced a new foreign investment law in March to give overseas firms more rights starting in 2020, but concerns remain about whether China will hold to its promises.For many American inventors such as Harker, blacklisting Chinese companies would be welcome news because it would make it difficult for U.S. retailers to buy from these Chinese firms, but others fear that it would open Pandora’s box, taking the entity list from a tool to protect U.S. national security to one that could be abused without clear guidelines.Trump says China will buy $50 billion a year of U.S. agriculture. That’s not what China says.“Everybody wants to put companies on the entity list now. This is Pandora’s box. In my opinion, this is hopelessly stupid,” said Mark Cohen, director of the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology. “When did Peter Navarro become a federal judge?” In the United States, most patent infringement cases are settled with no one admitting wrongdoing, making it difficult to assess if a firm is a repeat violator or not.Harker would like to see a three-strikes rule in place where a foreign company that has been sued for patent infringement three times by three different U.S. companies in a span of three years would be put on the entity list. By that definition, GreatStar might qualify. The Washington Post found three separate patent infringement cases against the company since 2017 and confirmed with parties involved that all were settled with one resulting in a permanent injunction.“I am not advocating you can never buy from China or Italy or wherever, but you should not buy from people who blatantly steal,” said Harker, who has shared his story with the White House. “Right now, the leverage is truly in a Chinese company’s court. It’s ten times more expense to defend a patent than infringe on it."" Groups like the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a think tank, have called for the United States and its allies to at least publish a bad actors list to publicly call out Chinese firms and individuals, even if the list doesn’t have the legal ramifications of being on Commerce’s entity list.A GreatStar spokeswoman denied any wrongdoing.“Over the past decade, GreatStar has been named as a defendant in only a handful of suits concerning patents or licensing, an especially small number considering the tens of thousands of products the company has developed and sold in that period,” said April Mills, a U.S. operations manager for GreatStar. “Importantly, none of these cases against GreatStar or its clients resulted in a court finding of any wrongdoing.” Bringing a patent infringement case is costly, and few companies will do it unless millions of dollars are a stake, said Jerold Schneider, who has worked on more than 200 IP cases, including one against GreatStar. He can see the appeal of having the federal government do more to go after Chinese firms since that takes the cost burden off the back of American companies. But he says the government would need to create a clear definition of what it takes to get a company on the blacklist.“The mere fact a company has been sued 10 times doesn’t tell you anything,” Schneider said.While Harker did bring a lawsuit against GreatStar, what helped him the most was that Tractor Supply swiftly pulled the item from its shelves after Harker explained his story, including sharing an email where GreatStar told him the product would be shipped to a British retailer, not an American one.Harker says most retailers are not as helpful.

"John Conyers Jr., long-serving congressman who co-founded Congressional Black Caucus, dies at 90",2019-10-28,Obituaries,"John Conyers Jr., who became the longest-serving African American in Congress, co-founded the Congressional Black Caucus and helped create a national holiday in the name of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. but whose career rapidly crumbled at 88 when he resigned amid sexual harassment allegations, died Oct. 27 at his home in Detroit. He was 90.His spokeswoman Holly Baird confirmed the death. Additional details were not immediately available.A liberal Democrat from what is now Detroit’s 13th Congressional District, Mr. Conyers was first elected in 1964, becoming one of five African Americans in the House. His overwhelmingly Democratic constituents reelected him 26 times over a period spanning 10 presidents, from Lyndon B. Johnson to Donald Trump.As the longest-serving member at the time of his resignation, Mr. Conyers earned the title “dean of the House of Representatives,” and this job security allowed him to promote liberal, sometimes controversial causes that won him a national following.He co-sponsored the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which prohibited discrimination at the ballot box. His fierce criticism of the Vietnam War led to clashes with Johnson and landed him on President Richard M. Nixon’s “enemies list” of political opponents.After the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Conyers voted against the USA Patriot Act because he said it would roll back civil liberties. He later suggested that President George W. Bush should be impeached, saying he misled the country ahead of the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq.Mr. Conyers’s twilight years were marred by allegations of sexual harassment. According to legal documents published by the online publication BuzzFeed in November 2017, several of his female staff members claimed that he had approached them to request sex and that he had engaged in unwanted touching and other impropriety.One former staff member received a settlement of more than $27,000 from Mr. Conyers’s office after alleging in 2015 that he fired her for not accepting his sexual advances. The congressman denied wrongdoing. But after the House Ethics Committee opened an investigation and numerous representatives called for him to step down in November 2017, Mr. Conyers quit his post as the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee. The next month, he announced his resignation after 52 years in office.“My legacy can’t be compromised or diminished in any way by what we are going through now,” Mr. Conyers declared defiantly. “This, too, shall pass.”Before the scandal, Mr. Con­yers had been an inspiration to African Americans from Detroit to the Deep South and had become, in effect, a member of Congress at large.“In many districts around the country, black voters did not feel represented by their leaders, so they would reach out to African American congressmen like Con­yers,” said Michael Fauntroy, who interned for Mr. Conyers in the early 1980s and is now an assistant professor of political science at Howard University.Mr. Conyers, in turn, urged skeptical African Americans to get involved in politics. One of his early mottos was: “Register, vote, run for office. It’s power that counts.” To better harness that power and secure passage of legislation on poverty, racism, human rights, unfair tax policies and health care, Mr. Conyers and 12 other African American House members founded the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971.Mr. Conyers strongly backed the Rev. Jesse Jackson’s 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination and was an early supporter of candidate Barack Obama, who was then a Democratic senator from Illinois. Yet Mr. Conyers also could be caustic about fellow Democrats to demonstrate that he was not blindly loyal to anyone.In 1979, he described President Jimmy Carter as a “hopeless, demented, honest, well-intentioned nerd who will never get past his first administration.” Decades later, Mr. Conyers criticized Obama for making foreign policy too dependent on military muscle. His intention, Mr. Con­yers said of Obama, was “to make him a better president.”He presented himself as an emeritus member of the Washington establishment and had participated in many high-profile political battles.Mr. Conyers was the only member of the House Judiciary Committee to take part in impeachment proceedings against Nixon in 1974 for the Watergate bugging scandal and coverup, and against President Bill Clinton in 1998 for lying about his affair with White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky.Mr. Conyers considered Nixon a criminal and helped draft articles of impeachment against the president before he resigned. However, he called the effort to impeach Clinton a Republican coup d’etat and “the most tragic event in my career.” He voted “no” when the House voted to impeach Clinton. Eight years later, Mr. Conyers became the first African American to chair the Judiciary Committee.All along, Mr. Conyers was a master of the politics of symbolism. He hired civil rights activist Rosa Parks, who worked in his Detroit office for 20 years. He introduced numerous bills calling for reparations for the descendants of slaves, an issue that resonated among black people but did not gain traction in Congress. More successful was his 15-year struggle to recognize King, the civil rights defender.Four days after King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, and with the support of his widow, Coretta Scott King, Mr. Conyers proposed the first of many bills calling for a federal holiday in his honor.The proposal met resistance from Republicans, notably Sen. Jesse Helms (N.C.), who accused King of Communist sympathies and complained that only one other holiday, Columbus Day, was named after a person.Mr. Conyers kept pushing, millions of people signed petitions and entertainer Stevie Wonder pitched in with the hit single “Happy Birthday.” President Ronald Reagan in 1983 signed legislation setting aside the third Monday in January as Martin Luther King Jr. Day; the day was chosen because it was near King’s Jan. 15 birthday.In a 2008 interview, Mr. Con­yers called it “far and away the thing I am most proud of.”But as the Detroit Free Press, his hometown paper, once described it, “For every brilliant move, there’s a dud.” Mr. Conyers was famous for missing votes on the House floor. Critics claimed that his effectiveness was dulled by growing arrogance and a refusal to compromise. He was prone to gaffes, prompting Time magazine political columnist Joe Klein to call him “foolishly incendiary.”When Mr. Conyers ran for mayor of Detroit in 1989, challenging Democratic incumbent Coleman A. Young, he announced his bid by saying, “Move over, Big Daddy, I’m home.” Mr. Conyers finished third in the primary and then lost again in 1993.Mr. Conyers could be a demanding boss. In addition to the allegations that he sexually harassed staff members, the House Ethics Committee investigated him for pressuring staff members to babysit his children and to chauffeur him to private events in government vehicles.After an investigation that lasted more than two years, the panel announced a deal in 2006 in which it dropped the inquiry in return for Mr. Conyers’s promise that he would not ask his staff members to do nonofficial work for him.In 2009, Mr. Conyers’s wife, Monica Esters Conyers — a former campaign staff member 36 years his junior — was convicted of bribery while serving on the Detroit City Council and was sentenced to 37 months in prison.John James Conyers Jr. was born in Detroit on May 16, 1929. He served in the Army Corps of Engineers during the Korean War. With the help of the G.I. Bill for veterans, he graduated from Detroit’s Wayne State University in 1957 and its law school in 1958.His interest in public affairs was partly because of his father’s position as an international representative for the United Auto Workers and, for a time, Mr. Conyers worked as a labor lawyer. He also was a legislative assistant to Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.), one of the few House members to serve even longer than Mr. Conyers.In the early 1960s, local Democratic Party elders considered Mr. Conyers too young to pursue federal office. Despite their opposition, Mr. Conyers ran in the 1964 Democratic primary for what was then Detroit’s 1st Congressional District and won by a mere 45 votes. He then scored a landslide victory in the general election.Mr. Conyers, who is survived by his wife, a brother and two sons, John III and Carl, would later fend off challenges from candidates who hadn’t yet been born when he was first elected.",john conyers jr long-serving congressman co-founded congressional black caucus dy john conyers jr became longest-serving african american congress

"Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, extremist leader of Islamic State, dies at 48",2019-10-28,Obituaries,"When Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi took the reins of the Islamic State of Iraq in 2010, few had heard of the organization or its new leader, then an austere religious scholar with wire-frame glasses and no known aptitude for fighting and killing.But just four years later, Mr. Baghdadi had helped transform his failing movement into one of the most notorious, vicious and — for a time — successful terrorist groups of modern times. Under his guidance, it would burst into the public consciousness as the Islamic State, an organization that would seize control of entire cities in Iraq and Syria and become a byword for shocking brutality.He died Oct. 26 in northwest Syria, during a raid conducted by Special Operations forces, President Trump said in a Sunday morning news conference at the White House. Mr. Baghdadi was 48, and had run into a “dead-end tunnel” before he “ignited his vest,” killing himself and three of his children, Trump said.“Baghdadi was vicious and violent, and he died in a vicious and violent way — as a coward, running and crying,” the president added.Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi dead following U.S. Special Operations raid in SyriaThe man at the helm of the Islamic State was a shadowy presence, appearing in public only a handful of times and rarely allowing his own voice to be heard, even as the caliphate was beaten back and finally destroyed. During his tenure, the Islamic State would come to mirror its leader: a messianic figure drawn to the harshest interpretations of Islamic texts and seized with the conviction that all dissenters should be put to death.Yet, despite the group’s extremist views and vicious tactics, Mr. Baghdadi maintained a canny pragmatism as leader, melding a fractious mix of radical Islamist militants and former Iraqi Baathists and army officers into a powerful military force capable of overrunning cities and defeating Iraqi divisions in battle. It was this combination of extremist ideology and practical military experience that enabled the group to seize and hold territory that would form the basis of a declared Islamic caliphate.“He was the guy who could build bridges between the foreign fighters and local Iraqis,” said William McCants, a scholar of militant Islam and author of “The ISIS Apocalypse,” a 2015 history of the Islamic State, which is also called ISIS. “His ability to move between these two factions helped his rise to become caliph and then allowed him to stay on top.”Mr. Baghdadi also embraced a kind of extreme brutality that would become the group’s trademark. While his predecessors gained notoriety with videotaped beheadings and bombings of school playgrounds, Mr. Baghdadi reveled in ghoulish displays of violence, often as the subject of elaborately produced videos. His followers carried out mass crucifixions, turned female captives into sex slaves and gleefully executed prisoners by stoning, hacking or burning them alive — always with Mr. Baghdadi’s implicit blessing.But his image among his followers took a pounding as a U.S.-led military coalition began driving the Islamic State from its strongholds, beginning in western Iraq in 2015 and continuing in a relentless string of defeats that included the fall of the group’s Iraqi and Syrian capitals in 2017 and 2018. In March, the last square-mile patch of the once-vast caliphate was destroyed by Kurdish fighters backed by U.S. warplanes. Through it all, Mr. Baghdadi remained largely invisible, drawing criticism from within his own organization for being remote and ineffective as a leader.After the caliphate’s collapse, he appeared twice in video messages, insisting that the Islamic State was rebuilding itself as an underground insurgency and vowing to fight on. Indeed, the group — which Pentagon officials estimate still commands between 14,000 and 18,000 fighters — has stepped up its low-grade guerrilla war against Iraqi, Syrian and Kurdish targets in recent months.Mr. Baghdadi’s last video statement, in September, urged followers to target prisons in parts of Kurdish-held Syria where thousands of militants are being held.“The prisons, the prisons, oh soldiers of the caliphate,” he said. “Your brothers and sisters — do your utmost to free them and tear down the walls restricting them.”The man who would become the founding leader of the world’s most brutal terrorist group spent his early adult years as an obscure academic, aiming for a quiet life as a professor of Islamic law. But the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003 upended his plans and launched him on a course toward insurgency, prison and violent jihad.He was born Ibrahim Awwad Ibrahim al-Badri in the central Iraqi city of Samarra on July 28, 1971. He grew up in a devout Sunni Muslim family that included several clerics and claimed to descend from the prophet Muhammad. That assertion later proved vital to Mr. Baghdadi’s efforts to anoint himself as “caliph,” or leader of the Islamic caliphate.From his teens, he was fascinated with Islamic history and the intricacies of Islamic law. Acquaintances would remember him as a shy, nearsighted youth who liked soccer but preferred to spend his free time at the local mosque.“He always had religious or other books attached on the back of his bike,” Tariq Hameed, an acquaintance from the same lower-middle-class neighborhood, told a Newsweek interviewer in 2014. The young Ibrahim disdained the Western clothes popular with Samarra’s young men, preferring the traditional prayer cap, beard and white dishdasha robe of the religiously devout, neighbors said.He graduated from the University of Baghdad in 1996 and received a master’s degree in Koranic recitation from the Saddam University for Islamic Studies in 1999. Immersing himself in the arcane world of 7th-century religious codes, he grew increasingly conservative. Acquaintances remembered how the college-age Mr. Baghdadi took offense at the sight of men and women dancing in the same room during wedding celebrations.By 2003, at age 31, he was well on his way to a doctorate and a shot at a full professorship. But after U.S. troops invaded Iraq that year, he signed up with a local resistance movement, explaining afterward that he did so as a religious duty. It would take four more years, until 2007, before he returned to school to defend his dissertation, also in Koranic recitation.He was arrested in the Iraqi city of Fallujah in 2004 and, in a fateful turn, landed at the notorious and now-defunct Camp Bucca prison. The vast, U.S.-run detention facility warehoused nearly 26,000 Iraqi men at a time in communal tents, and U.S. military officials later acknowledged it served at times as a recruitment and training center for militants.“Extremists mingled with moderates in every compound,” Vasilios Tasikas, who served at the time as a Coast Guard lieutenant commander in charge of legal operations at the prison, wrote in a 2009 essay in the Military Review. Over time, he wrote, the mixing of hardened militants and Iraqi civilians “fueled the insurgency inside the wire.”Mr. Baghdadi, as he began to call himself, forged a number of important alliances in the camp, befriending several members of the terrorist network run by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, the Jordanian who founded al-Qaeda in Iraq, the notoriously brutal group known for beheading hostages and attacking relief organizations and Shiite mosques and schools.After he was released by the prison’s U.S. overseers in late 2004, Mr. Baghdadi became a Zarqawi disciple, gradually rising through the organization to become a religious instructor and adviser to local terrorist cells in Iraq’s Anbar province.In 2006, U.S. forces struck major blows against al-Qaeda in Iraq, killing Zarqawi and wiping out entire branches of the group’s senior leadership chart. By 2008, U.S. intelligence officials viewed the organization as all but defeated. Mr. Baghdadi managed to avoid capture and, by 2010, he had risen to the No. 3 position — senior spiritual adviser.When Iraqi and U.S. troops killed the group’s top two commanders that year, Mr. Baghdadi was thrust suddenly into the No. 1 leadership position as the head of a rebranded, but badly weakened, organization that had begun to call itself the Islamic State of Iraq.Mr. Baghdadi’s backers in his new role included a number of former officers of Saddam Hussein’s vanquished army — Sunni colonels and majors who had initially allied themselves with Zarqawi had moved to assert Iraqi control over the group after his death. To them, Mr. Baghdadi might have seemed an ideal figurehead: an Iraqi religious scholar with ancestral lineage to the prophet Muhammad, perfect credentials for a future head of a restored Islamic state, or caliphate, a kind of theocratic Muslim empire that has not existed since the time of the Ottomans.In reality, even they understood that the “state” was a fiction.“Where is this Islamic State of Iraq that you’re talking about?” one of the leader’s wives complained, according to documents from a 2010 Iraqi court case. “We’re living in a desert!”Events elsewhere in the Middle East provided Mr. Baghdadi’s group with an unexpected opportunity. Beginning in late 2010 and continuing through 2011, the Arab Spring movement toppled leaders and sparked a succession of conflicts, including what became the vicious, sectarian-tinged civil war in Syria. For Mr. Baghdadi, the war on Iraq’s western border offered the very things his group needed most: a new cause, and a fresh and nearly boundless source of recruits and arms.Mr. Baghdadi dispatched trusted followers to Syria in late 2011 to form an Islamist rebel group called Jabhat al-Nusra. But in 2013, when the new offshoot proved difficult to control, he plunged into the war himself.He dispatched scores of fighters into Syria and rebranded his organization yet again, calling it the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham, the latter term being the ancient name for the region that encompasses Syria and most of the Levant. Popularly the group would be known by its Arabic acronym, Daesh, or in English, ISIS or ISIL. Later the name would be shortened to simply the Islamic State.Feuding would continue for years between Mr. Baghdadi’s men and Jabhat al-Nusra, which eventually aligned with al-Qaeda. The Islamic State emerged as the most effective fighting force on the rebel side, capturing the eastern city of Raqqa and challenging other rebel groups for dominance across a swath of villages along the Euphrates River.There, Mr. Baghdadi imposed strict Islamic law on local inhabitants, enforcing the rules with public floggings, amputations and executions, while his fighters consolidated their holdings and prepared for future expansion across Syria and Iraq.Mr. Baghdadi still was in command a year later when the Islamic State’s forces roared into Iraq in late spring 2014, routing poorly led, demoralized Iraqi army divisions in a string of stunning defeats across the west and north.By that June, his Islamist militant army controlled a third of Iraq’s territory, including Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest city. His holdings included not just real estate, but also oil fields, military bases, universities and hundreds of millions of dollars in cash. Almost overnight, the Islamic State was transformed into the wealthiest and best-armed terrorist group of all time.A triumphant Mr. Baghdadi marched into one of Mosul’s oldest mosques to declare the start of a new Islamic caliphate, with himself as leader. Allowing cameras to record his movements, the bearded, slightly pudgy cleric climbed to the mosque’s minbar, or pulpit, to congratulate his followers on the start of what he described as a new chapter in human history.“You will conquer Rome and own the world,” he said.Mr. Baghdadi’s victories were short-lived. The group’s shocking displays of violence, combined with a bloody terror campaign against Western cities, helped to deepen international resolve to drive the Islamic State from its stronghold, depriving it of a sanctuary and a central element of its propaganda.The U.S.-led military coalition launched in 2014 and grew to include 81 countries, from the Middle East to Europe to Asia. With Iraqi, Kurdish and Arab fighters at the lead, the coalition began slowly liberating Iraqi and Syrian cities as U.S. drones picked off a steady succession of Islamic State leaders.U.S.-backed Iraqi forces retook the group’s Iraqi capital of Mosul in a campaign that ran from 2015 to early 2017. The Islamic State’s Syrian capital, Raqqa, was liberated in 2017, and the caliphate’s final outpost at Baghouz, Syria, was recaptured in March.From the group’s high-water mark to its collapse, its leader remained a phantom presence. Little is publicly known about what he did, how he contributed or where he lived. Mr. Baghdadi likewise kept his family and social life carefully hidden. He married at least twice, possibly three times, and had at least six children.Later, former hostages would reveal that Mr. Baghdadi also kept a number of personal sex slaves during his years as the Islamic State’s leader, including American hostage Kayla Mueller, who was later killed, and a number of captured Yazidi women. U.S. officials corroborated the accounts.Terrorism experts say his avoidance of the spotlight was probably deliberate and strategic. Unlike his more charismatic predecessor Zarqawi, whose gun-toting image made him an icon within the militant community, Mr. Baghdadi seemed to have preferred to keep the focus on the caliphate itself, the mythical Islamic utopia he believed he was creating.It was also a way to ensure that the terrorist group could survive the loss of its leader. On the day Mr. Baghdadi’s death was announced, pro-Islamic State social media forums posted reports of the day’s latest terrorist attacks and messages of encouragement to followers.“Al-Baghdadi, although influential, is but one person,” said a writer posting Sunday in one such forum. “The term ‘caliphate’ that ISIS promotes is not a temporary idea whereby if one person died, the whole term or ideology ends.”Read more Washington Post obituaries

"Hildegard Bachert, who introduced Klimt and Grandma Moses to the American art scene, dies at 98",2019-10-28,Obituaries,"Hildegard Bachert, a refu­gee of Nazi Germany who became a vital behind-the-scenes force in the New York City art world, introducing American collectors to German and Austrian Expressionists including Gustav Klimt and the Upstate New York farm wife who became known as Grandma Moses, died Oct. 17 at a hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 98.The cause was a ruptured colon, said Jane Kallir, director of the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan, where Ms. Bachert worked for more than three quarters of a century. She was hired in 1940 as an assistant to the founder, Otto Kallir, an Austrian Jew who also had fled Nazi Europe, and after his death in 1978 served as co-director with his granddaughter Jane.Ms. Bachert, who dedicated nearly her entire life to cultivating the legacies of artists who might otherwise have gone unnoticed or underappreciated, once remarked that she developed her “consciousness of art” only after arriving in the United States when she was 15. “After all,” she said, before that time “there were other concerns.”She was 12 when Hitler came to power in Germany in 1933 and initiated his campaign of anti-Semitic persecution. Three years later, according to an account of her life that she gave to the Smithsonian Institution’s Archives of American Art, she was expelled from her school because she was Jewish.Jews were banned from the Kunsthalle Mannheim, the art museum in her hometown. Her youth notwithstanding, she said, she understood that modern art, deemed “degenerate” under National Socialism, had become taboo.Her father, a lawyer, saw the “handwriting on the wall,” Ms. Bachert said in the 1993 Smithsonian oral history, and sent her and her older sister to the United States, where a relative had agreed to help support them. In New York, Ms. Bachert learned English, completed high school and reveled in the cultural offerings of the city’s libraries and concert halls. She wore out the old-world clothing she had brought from Europe, she said, to spend what little money she had on student tickets to Carnegie Hall.Ms. Bachert also frequented the city’s art galleries and worked for Karl Nierendorf, a German gallery owner who at the time was struggling to sell the works of now-celebrated modern artists including Paul Klee and Wassily Kandinsky, before Otto Kallir hired her.Kallir had run the Neue Galerie in Vienna, where he showed the works of artists including Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch and championed the Austrian Expressionist Egon Schiele, among others. In the United States, Kallir encountered an art world where “French art was ‘in’ and German art was ‘out,’ ” Ms. Bachert once told the online art publication NeotericArt.“It was also because of the war going on in the 1940s,” she said. “There was great antagonism to German art.”At Galerie St. Etienne, Kallir, with Ms. Bachert’s help, mounted the first solo shows in the United States of Schiele (1941) and Klimt (1959). Today, both are recognized as giants of modernism and command accordingly giant sums.In 2006, Ronald S. Lauder, the cosmetics heir and art collector, paid a reported $135 million — the highest price ever fetched by a painting at the time — for a shimmering gold Klimt portrait of the Viennese hostess Adele Bloch-Bauer. The painting had been the subject of one of the most high-profile restitution claims involving artwork looted during the Holocaust, a story dramatized in the 2015 film “Woman in Gold” starring Helen Mirren. The painting is housed in Lauder’s Neue Galerie in Manhattan, whose name is an homage to Kallir’s Viennese gallery.Other Austrian and German artists that Ms. Bachert helped promote included Oskar Kokoschka, Alfred Kubin, Paula Modersohn-Becker and Käthe Kollwitz.Grandma Moses — her real name was Anna Mary Robertson Moses — was brought to Kallir’s attention by Louis Caldor, an amateur collector who had stumbled on a sampling of her bucolic folk art at a drugstore in Hoosick Falls, N.Y. Moses had taken up painting well into her older age and pursued her hobby in obscurity until Caldor promised to make her famous.Kallir loved America “as only a refugee can,” according to the gallery, and saw in Moses “an artist capable of capturing the authentic spirit of his new homeland.” Galerie St. Etienne gave Moses her first one-person show in 1940, a month before Ms. Bachert was hired, when Moses was 80. Thus began a relationship that lasted until Moses died at 101, so famous that she was often compared to Norman Rockwell.Ms. Bachert became the gallery’s chief contact for Moses and recalled going strawberry-picking with her, as well as assisting her with her autobiography, “My Life’s History,” which Kallir edited.“People often brand her work as nostalgic. It may be so for them. But Grandma Moses was not nostalgic. She was among the most unsentimental persons I ever knew,” Ms. Bachert once told the Hartford Courant. “She had so much common sense and knowledge of life, and all that came through in her pictures.”Hildegard Gina Bachert was born in Mannheim on April 3, 1921. Her parents survived the Nazi attacks of Kristallnacht before joining their daughters in the United States, where her father, a former lawyer, became blind, and her mother helped support the family as a seamstress.Even with a scholarship to Oberlin College in Ohio, Ms. Bachert did not have enough money to pursue university studies. She took free classes at Hunter College in New York City while working. Her first job was as a housekeeper and nanny for a doctor’s family. “I lasted three days,” she said in the Smithsonian oral history. “Luckily for art.”Jane Kallir credited Ms. Bachert with assisting the gallery in its efforts to help return artwork looted by Nazis to their former Jewish owners or their heirs.“She was someone who had actually lived through part of the Nazi time in Germany and who knew all of these people who had been robbed by the Nazis,” Jane Kallir said in an interview. Speaking of the German and Austrian Expressionist artwork that Ms. Bachert had sought to preserve, Kallir observed that “both for Hildegard and for my grandfather, this was an important part of their heritage that the Nazis had tried to destroy.”Ms. Bachert never married and had no immediate survivors. She stayed so long with Galerie St. Etienne, she said, because “I felt fulfilled.”“I felt that my potential was tapped,” she said in the Smithsonian oral history, “that I was able to give … And that’s what I wanted to do.”Read more Washington Post obituaries

"Ed Clark, abstract painter whose brush was a broom, dies at 93",2019-10-28,Obituaries,"Ed Clark, a noted abstract painter who achieved his distinctive effect by using a janitor’s broom to sweep paint across the canvas in giant, motion-filled strokes, died Oct. 18 at a care center in Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich. He was 93.His death was announced by the gallery Hauser & Wirth, which represented him. The cause was complications from heart ailments, said his daughter, Melanca Clark.Mr. Clark achieved widespread recognition relatively late in his career, which he had begun with art studies on the GI Bill after World War II. As an African American, he was long excluded from many white-owned galleries. He forged his artistic identity during the postwar years in Paris, where black artists such as Beauford Delaney
 and writers including James Baldwin had sought escape from the rampant discrimination they found in the United States.Mr. Clark was working in his studio in the Montparnasse neighborhood of Paris, he recounted, when he decided that the painting on which he was laboring called for an unusually wide brush. He found one in the janitor’s closet. He would later dub his technique, in which he took a push broom to a canvas laid flat on the floor, “the big sweep.”“That’s what the push broom gives you, speed,” he once told an interviewer. “Maybe it’s something psychological. It’s like cutting through everything. It’s also anger or something like it, to go through it in a big sweep.”Mr. Clark’s paintings featured “all the colors of the spectrum,” he once said in an interview at the Pérez Art Museum Miami — from rich oranges, reds and purples to gentle pastels, sometimes in juxtaposition with one another. For some viewers, the sweeping lines formed by the bristles of his broom evoked the colorful strata of a sunset; for others, they looked like waves.In a tribute after his death, the publication Art News described his paintings as exuding “the rare and exquisite sense of having come instantly into being with just a few pushes of his broom. Their brash, joyous confidence comes from the tool’s movement, but also from his unique sense for color — where, say, mint green, lava red, and aquamarine can hover together gloriously.”Many of his works featured ovals and shaped canvases, a practice that he was credited with helping to pioneer. He described his work as having a life of its own — “You just let it go,” he said — and told the publication Black Renaissance Noire that he sometimes let galleries decide “which way is up” when they displayed a painting of his.By the end of his life, his work was exhibited in institutions including the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Art Institute of Chicago and the Smithsonian Institution’s National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.Edward Clark Jr. was born on May 6, 1926, in New Orleans and grew up largely in Chicago.He told Bomb magazine that his paternal grandmother, who was black, was 14 when she had his father, and that the baby’s father was a white sheriff. Mr. Clark’s father could “pass” as white, the artist said, but never wished to do so. He worked a variety of jobs, including construction work, and was fired from one of them when his employer discovered his race.Mr. Clark described his mother as a devout Catholic, and he attended Catholic schools before leaving high school to enlist in the Army Air Forces during World War II. After serving in Guam, he began his formal art studies, first at the Art Institute of Chicago and later in Paris at the Académie de la Grande Chaumière.The artistic ferment in Paris proved enormously invigorating for Mr. Clark. “New York in that moment was not considered the capital of the art world — it was Paris,” he said. “They were all alive, man! Picasso, Braque, both of them. Everybody was there!” He was also deeply inspired by Nicolas de Staël, a French painter of Russian origin who was known for the thick paint that he applied in his abstract works.In 1957, Mr. Clark settled in New York — although he would return to Paris throughout his life — and helped form the Brata Gallery, a cooperative that showcased the works of a racially diverse group of artists. He traveled extensively for his artwork, including to the American Southwest, the Caribbean, Brazil, the Mediterranean, Africa and China, seeking new landscapes and shades of light to inspire him.Mr. Clark’s marriages to Muriel Nelson, Lola Owens, Hedy Durham and Liping An ended in divorce. Survivors include a daughter from his third marriage, Melanca Clark of Detroit, and two grandchildren.During his formative years in Paris, Mr. Clark studied the Old Masters as well as modern art. But then as after, he was drawn inexorably to the abstract form.“It struck me that if I paint a person — no matter how I do it — it is a lie,” he once remarked, according to the Art Institute of Chicago. “The truth is in the physical brushstroke and the subject of the painting is the paint itself.”Read more Washington Post obituaries

'We need to find my sister': More than 100 join search for British backpacker missing on Cambodian island,"October 28, 2019 22:44:36",World,"About 150 police, divers and volunteers are searching for a 21-year-old British woman who has been missing for five days on a Cambodian island popular with backpackers. Amelia Bambridge, from West Sussex, was last seen at about 3:00am on Thursday morning leaving a beach party on Koh Rong island in the province of Sihanoukville on the southwestern coast, said Sihanoukville governor Kouch Chamroeun, who led a search on Monday that included eight volunteer divers.Mr Chamroeun said Ms Bambridge's bag containing her belongings, including a mobile phone, credit cards and a watch, was found on a rock near the water's edge at Police Beach.""There is a high suspicion that she may have drowned,"" Mr Chamroeun said.""Looking at her phone, she has taken pictures and posted online until 3:23am."" Police were also investigating the possibility of foul play, and authorities had alerted fishermen at sea to help, Mr Chamroeun added.""We searched in the jungle, in people's houses and various guesthouses yesterday, and we didn't get any result yet. We are still continuing the search.""Major General Chuon Narin, police chief of the province, said about 150 divers, policemen, navy personnel, local volunteers and foreigners were taking part in the search. Mr Narin expressed guarded optimism Ms Bambridge might still be found alive and said several foreign tourists had previously gone missing but were found safe after being lost in the island's jungle.The island's Governor Nuon Bunthol told the ABC the search party had already covered almost half of the island, and water searches began yesterday.""It is hard for me to conclude if foul play was involved. The materials she brought with her are still left untouched,"" he said.On Saturday, traveller Laura Li posted on an expat and local community Facebook pages that searchers had covered a lot of ground in the days after Ms Bambridge went missing. ""It was hard work out there and anyone helping needs to be prepared for that,"" she wrote.Covered in swathes of dense, lush jungle, the relatively undeveloped Koh Rong spans about 78 square kilometres and is fringed by idyllic white sand beaches.It is popular among backpackers, some of whom who travel there for the island's regular, privately run parties on Police Beach, which some online reviews have said feature illegal drug use.Koh Rong lies in the Gulf of Thailand about 25 kilometres from Sihanoukville, a once-sleepy seaside town that has in recent years been transformed by Chinese investment.It is now a deep-sea port swollen with dozens of soaring high-rise casinos, huge factories and glitzy condominiums.Concern was raised on Thursday when Ms Bambridge was not seen at the island's Nest Beach Club hostel, where she had been staying and left her passport.Ms Bambridge's family has flown to Koh Rong to join the search, her sister, Georgie Bambridge, said on her Instagram account.""I don't think she's in the sea. I think she's inland somewhere,"" her father Phil Bambridge told Britain's Sky News, adding he thought someone had taken her.""If she'd had an accident she'd have been found by now.""Just over a week ago, three Cambodian men were charged with gang-raping a French tourist in the coastal province of Kampot, about 130 kilometres east of Koh Rong.Georgie Bambridge told Sky News that her sister had wanted to travel her whole life.""She has spent the past two years saving for it and spent the last year reading blogs of travellers, researching what she was going to do,"" she said.Her family said her trip to Asia began on September 27, when she flew to Vietnam. ""Please share — the more people looking, the sooner we'll find her,"" Georgie Bambridge posted on Sunday.""We need to find my sister.""A spokeswoman for the British embassy in Phnom Penh said it was assisting the family of a British woman reported missing in Cambodia and it was in close contact with the police.ABC/Wires",need find sister join search british backpacker missing cambodian island police diver volunteer searching -year-old british woman ha missing five day cambodian island popular backpacker amelia bambridge west sussex wa last seen thursday morning leaving beach party koh rong island province sihanoukville southwestern coast said sihanoukville governor kouch chamroeun led search monday included eight volunteer diver mr chamroeun said bambridge bag containing belonging including mobile phone credit card watch wa found rock near water edge police beach `` high suspicion may drowned `` mr chamroeun said `` looking phone ha taken picture posted online `` police also investigating possibility foul play authority alerted fisherman sea help mr chamroeun added `` searched jungle people house various guesthouse yesterday get result yet still continuing search `` major general chuon narin police chief province said diver policeman navy personnel local volunteer foreigner taking part search mr narin expressed guarded optimism bambridge might still found alive said several foreign tourist previously gone missing found safe lost island jungle island governor nuon bunthol told abc search party already covered almost half island water search began yesterday `` hard conclude foul play wa involved material brought still left untouched `` said saturday traveller laura li posted expat local community facebook page searcher covered lot ground day bambridge went missing `` wa hard work anyone helping need prepared `` wrote covered swathe dense lush jungle relatively undeveloped koh rong span square kilometre fringed idyllic white sand beach popular among backpacker travel island regular privately run party police beach online review said feature illegal drug use koh rong lie gulf thailand kilometre sihanoukville once-sleepy seaside town ha recent year transformed chinese investment deep-sea port swollen dozen soaring high-rise casino huge factory glitzy condominium concern wa raised thursday bambridge wa seen island nest beach club hostel staying left passport bambridge family ha flown koh rong join search sister georgie bambridge said instagram account `` think sea think inland somewhere `` father phil bambridge told britain sky news adding thought someone taken `` accident found `` week ago three cambodian men charged gang-raping french tourist coastal province kampot kilometre east koh rong georgie bambridge told sky news sister wanted travel whole life `` ha spent past two year saving spent last year reading blog traveller researching wa going `` said family said trip asia began september flew vietnam `` please share people looking sooner find `` georgie bambridge posted sunday `` need find sister `` spokeswoman british embassy phnom penh said wa assisting family british woman reported missing cambodia wa close contact police abc wire ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-28/british-backpacker-amelia-bambridge-missing-on-cambodian-island/11647802?section=world,2019-10-28,ABC News
Alleged driver of truck carrying 39 bodies remanded in custody,"October 28, 2019 22:22:52",World,"The man accused of the manslaughter of 39 people found dead in a refrigerated truck east of London has been remanded in custody.Maurice ""Mo"" Robinson, 25, appeared briefly at Chelmsford Magistrates Court in Essex charged with 39 counts of manslaughter, conspiracy to traffic people and money laundering.Mr Robinson, from Craigavon in Northern Ireland, was arrested on October 23 after police found the bodies of 39 people in the back of a truck he was allegedly driving.The prosecution opposed bail citing the ""gravity"" of the case and said Mr Robinson could interfere with the investigation because he is likely to be part of a global ring that has ""facilitated large numbers of illegal migrants entering the UK"". Wearing a grey jumper and appearing via videolink, he confirmed his name and address and told the court his nationality was British, before District Judge Timothy King remanded him in custody.Mr Robinson is set to next appear at London's Old Bailey on November 25. On Sunday three people arrested in connection with the investigation were released on bail.All three had been questioned on suspicion of manslaughter and conspiracy to traffic people.A man and a woman from Warrington in northern England have both been released on bail until November 11, while a man from Northern Ireland has been bailed until November 13, police said in a statement.Another man arrested by Irish police in Dublin on Saturday over another matter is considered by Essex Police to be a ""person of interest"" in the case.""We are liaising with the Garda via telephone as this man is currently held outside the jurisdiction of the law of England and Wales,"" a police spokesman told the BBC.Initially, British police believed the victims were Chinese, but later sought help from the Vietnamese community.Chinese and Vietnamese officials were both working closely with British police, the countries' embassies said.A Catholic priest in the remote town of Yen Thanh in Nghe An province said on Saturday he believed most of the dead were likely from Vietnam.",alleged driver truck carrying body remanded custody man accused manslaughter people found dead refrigerated truck east london ha remanded custody maurice `` mo '' robinson appeared briefly chelmsford magistrate court essex charged count manslaughter conspiracy traffic people money laundering mr robinson craigavon northern ireland wa arrested october police found body people back truck wa allegedly driving prosecution opposed bail citing `` gravity '' case said mr robinson could interfere investigation likely part global ring ha `` facilitated large number illegal migrant entering uk '' wearing grey jumper appearing via videolink confirmed name address told court nationality wa british district judge timothy king remanded custody mr robinson set next appear london old bailey november sunday three people arrested connection investigation released bail three questioned suspicion manslaughter conspiracy traffic people man woman warrington northern england released bail november man northern ireland ha bailed november police said statement another man arrested irish police dublin saturday another matter considered essex police `` person interest '' case `` liaising garda via telephone man currently held outside jurisdiction law england wale `` police spokesman told bbc initially british police believed victim chinese later sought help vietnamese community chinese vietnamese official working closely british police country embassy said catholic priest remote town yen thanh nghe province said saturday believed dead likely vietnam ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-28/maurice-robinson-essex-truck-driver-appears-in-court/11647672?section=world,2019-10-28,ABC News
European Union agrees to grant United Kingdom three-month Brexit extension,"October 28, 2019 20:34:28",World,"The European Union has agreed to delay Brexit until January 31 next year — just three days before it was due to take place.European Council president Donald Tusk said on Twitter the EU's 27 other countries agreed to accept ""the UK's request for a Brexit flextension until 31 January, 2020"".""The decision is expected to be formalised through a written procedure,"" he added.The term flextension means the UK will be able to leave earlier if the Brexit deal secured by Prime Minister Boris Johnson is ratified before that date. Mr Tusk's announcement came as European Union diplomats met in Brussels to sign off on the new delay for Britain's departure, which had been scheduled for October 31.Leaving the envoys, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told reporters ""it was a very short and efficient and constructive meeting and I am happy the decision has been taken"".He declined to provide details of the talks.Brexit has already been delayed twice — from March 29 and April 12 — after Mr Johnson's predecessor, Theresa May, failed to get her deal through the British Parliament.Mr Johnson was forced by opponents in Parliament to request a delay to avoid a ""no-deal"" departure from the European Union.In London, British politicians are later set to vote on whether to hold an early election to try to break the country's deadlock over Brexit. Mr Johnson wants a December 12 election, but looks unlikely to get the required support from two thirds of MPs.Two opposition parties plan to push for a December 9 election if Mr Johnson's proposal fails.AP ",european union agrees grant united kingdom three-month brexit extension european union ha agreed delay brexit january next year three day wa due take place european council president donald tusk said twitter eu country agreed accept `` uk request brexit flextension january `` `` decision expected formalised written procedure `` added term flextension mean uk able leave earlier brexit deal secured prime minister boris johnson ratified date mr tusk announcement came european union diplomat met brussels sign new delay britain departure scheduled october leaving envoy eu brexit negotiator michel barnier told reporter `` wa short efficient constructive meeting happy decision ha taken '' declined provide detail talk brexit ha already delayed twice march april mr johnson predecessor theresa may failed get deal british parliament mr johnson wa forced opponent parliament request delay avoid `` no-deal '' departure european union london british politician later set vote whether hold early election try break country deadlock brexit mr johnson want december election look unlikely get required support two third mp two opposition party plan push december election mr johnson proposal fails ap ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-28/european-union-grants-uk-three-month-brexit-extension/11647822?section=world,2019-10-28,ABC News
Southwest Airlines pilots allegedly caught live-streaming plane's toilet,"October 28, 2019 19:09:15",World,"A Southwest Airlines flight attendant has alleged that pilots on a 2017 flight had an iPad streaming video from a hidden camera in a toilet in one of the airline's jets. Attendant Renee Steinaker alleges in a lawsuit that she discovered an iPad streaming the video surveillance from the plane's front toilet about two and a half hours into a flight from Phoenix to Pittsburgh in 2017.Ms Steinaker was asked to enter the cockpit by Captain Terry Graham when he left the cockpit to use the toilet — a normal request given Southwest Airlines' policy that two members be in the cockpit at all times.According to the suit, Ms Steinaker noticed an iPad on the windshield showing a live video of Mr Graham in the toilet, according to a report in the Arizona Central.Meanwhile, co-pilot Ryan Russell — who was still in the cockpit with her — had a ""panicked look on his face"".Ms Steinaker alleges that the co-pilot acknowledged that the iPad was streaming from a camera in the toilet but asserted it was a ""new and top-secret security measure installed in all of Southwest's Boeing 737-800 planes"".The flight attendant then took a photo of the iPad video with her phone and provided the photo with a report to Southwest management but alleges she was warned by a supervisor to not tell anybody about the incident.Ms Steinaker alleges she was warned, ""if this got out, if this went public, no one, I mean no one, would ever fly our airline again"".The pilots were not sanctioned by Southwest Airlines and continued to pilot commercial flights for the airline, according to the lawsuit.Initially, Southwest Airlines declined to comment further on the lawsuit, but in a later statement called the 2017 incident an ""inappropriate attempt at humour"" not condoned by the company.Court filings by attorneys for the Dallas-based airline and the two pilots denied the live streaming allegations, while Southwest Airlines said in a statement it will vigorously contest the suit and denied it places cameras in aircraft lavatories.""When the incident happened two years ago, we investigated the allegations and addressed the situation with the crew involved,"" the company's statement said.""We can confirm from our investigation that there was never a camera in the lavatory; the incident was an inappropriate attempt at humour which the company did not condone.""The lawsuit against Southwest Airlines — a company known for its joking and irreverent behaviour by flight crews — and the two pilots was announced on Saturday by attorneys for Ms Steinaker and her husband, also a Southwest Airlines flight attendant.It comes less than a year after the airline issued an apology after a passenger claimed an employee mocked her five-year-old daughter's name, ""Abcde"", as they were preparing to board a Texas-bound flight homeThe couple's lawyer, Ronald LM Goldman, said the alleged live streaming would compromise safety by distracting crew members and intrude on the privacy of those using the toilet.""The cockpit of a commercial airliner is not a playground for peeping toms,"" Mr Goldman said in a statement.An initial version of the lawsuit alleged that both spouses experienced discrimination, harassment and retaliation in connection with Ms Steinaker's reporting of the inflight incident.A later version of the suit did not include those allegations but said they would be restored if the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission approved suing on those allegations.No trial date has been set for the case, which seeks specified awards based on various damages claims.AP/ABC",southwest airline pilot allegedly caught live-streaming plane toilet southwest airline flight attendant ha alleged pilot flight ipad streaming video hidden camera toilet one airline jet attendant renee steinaker alleges lawsuit discovered ipad streaming video surveillance plane front toilet two half hour flight phoenix pittsburgh steinaker wa asked enter cockpit captain terry graham left cockpit use toilet normal request given southwest airline policy two member cockpit time according suit steinaker noticed ipad windshield showing live video mr graham toilet according report arizona central meanwhile co-pilot ryan russell wa still cockpit `` panicked look face '' steinaker alleges co-pilot acknowledged ipad wa streaming camera toilet asserted wa `` new top-secret security measure installed southwest boeing - plane '' flight attendant took photo ipad video phone provided photo report southwest management alleges wa warned supervisor tell anybody incident steinaker alleges wa warned `` got went public one mean one would ever fly airline '' pilot sanctioned southwest airline continued pilot commercial flight airline according lawsuit initially southwest airline declined comment lawsuit later statement called incident `` inappropriate attempt humour '' condoned company court filing attorney dallas-based airline two pilot denied live streaming allegation southwest airline said statement vigorously contest suit denied place camera aircraft lavatory `` incident happened two year ago investigated allegation addressed situation crew involved `` company statement said `` confirm investigation wa never camera lavatory incident wa inappropriate attempt humour company condone `` lawsuit southwest airline company known joking irreverent behaviour flight crew two pilot wa announced saturday attorney steinaker husband also southwest airline flight attendant come le year airline issued apology passenger claimed employee mocked five-year-old daughter name `` abcde '' preparing board texas-bound flight homethe couple lawyer ronald lm goldman said alleged live streaming would compromise safety distracting crew member intrude privacy using toilet `` cockpit commercial airliner playground peeping tom `` mr goldman said statement initial version lawsuit alleged spouse experienced discrimination harassment retaliation connection steinaker reporting inflight incident later version suit include allegation said would restored federal equal employment opportunity commission approved suing allegation trial date ha set case seek specified award based various damage claim ap abc ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-28/southwest-airlines-pilots-live-streaming-video-toilet-plane/11647284?section=world,2019-10-28,ABC News
'I walked into a country pub and everyone just stopped',"October 28, 2019 05:50:08",Asia Pacific,"相关中文文章Walking along the main strip of Box Hill in Melbourne's east, you'd be forgiven for thinking you were on a street in suburban Shanghai.Shops are plastered in Chinese writing, restaurant after restaurant serves up all manner of Asian food, real estate agents speak Mandarin and Cantonese and even your banking can be done without speaking English.""Box Hill looks and feels like a residential area in Nanjing or Shanghai,"" said Kuan Yan, 77, who moved to Australia from China in 2003 and now lives in Box Hill North.It's for this reason areas like Box Hill, or Hurstville near Sydney and Sunnybank near Brisbane, have come in for some criticism. ""Spot the Aussie"" was said to be the title of one now-banned social media page complaining about the population of Box Hill.But those who have migrated to Australia and started out in areas like this say it's made the transition to a new society far easier. ""If they settle in Box Hill they feel like it's a more familiar environment,"" said Kuan Yan's daughter Lily Yan, who came to Australia in 1996 before later helping her mother to migrate.""They can settle in this community gradually and maybe later on after a few years they will move on to different suburbs and different places.""I do know from my own experience and my friends' experience that once they are here for a couple of years, as long as they don't have a language barrier anymore, they tend to move away.""Migration agent Sean Dong packed up his life in Shandong, China and moved to Melbourne with the aim of finishing high school here.He also lives near Box Hill, where more than one third of the population has Chinese ancestry, and said the focus should not be on any one community but rather what multiculturalism has brought to Australia.""You should embrace Australian culture, Australian people, or Korean people, or Aboriginal people, that's the value of this land,"" he said. Australia is one of the most culturally diverse countries in the world, with nearly a third of the population born overseas.There is overwhelming agreement that multiculturalism makes Australia a better place to live, but when it comes to how immigrants are fitting into society, people are more divided.The ABC's Australia Talks National Survey found Australians are split on whether immigrants try hard enough to fit in.While 50 per cent of people say immigrants do try hard, one in three think they are not doing enough.Lily Yan said she understood some concerns people may have, but said the first issue was working out what fitting in actually meant. When she first touched down in Australia by herself from China's Xinjiang region 22 years ago there was something she wanted to know straight away.""If I didn't really like the barbecue or didn't understand cricket does it mean I'm not Australian?"" she asked.""It's really hard to define … what it is exactly to be Australian.""In general, migrants do want to fit in, that's the whole reason they come here in the first place. But there's always barriers there.""She said young people who moved to Australia with a good grasp of the English language, or with a good chance of picking it up quickly, were far better placed than older migrants.""I know for example my mum tried really, really hard to learn English … but it's really difficult."" Mr Dong's wife Ming Kong moved from Suzhou in China to Australia in her early 20s to study and agrees with Lily Yan.""Personally I came as a student so I was trying very hard to fit in the society,"" Dr Kong said.""For people like my parents and in-laws, they try to fit in as well in different ways.""For example, English might not be their perfect thing that they're good at, but like my parents-in-law, they join a singing group and they perform.""I think it's just different ways of how people fit in.""'Australian value, Chinese culture, there's no conflict'People of Chinese ancestry now number more than 1.2 million in Australia, with universities one of the big drawcards; Chinese nationals make up 10 per cent of all university students in Australia.Mr Dong used to be one of these students. When he arrived in Australia in 2002 as a teenager he had hopes of one day graduating from a top Australian university. Now in a partnership running a migration business with more than 30 employees, Mr Dong said there was nothing wrong with differences.""Fitting in is not necessarily becoming the same. There is a Chinese saying that you try to find similarities but also respect the difference. I think that's the sense of fitting in,"" said Mr Dong, who now has a master's degree in immigration law from the University of Melbourne.""Preserving the cultural tradition is important, it's good. There's nothing wrong with that.""Australian value, Chinese culture, there's no conflict.""Mr Dong's parents migrated to Australia six years ago and live nearby as part of the Chinese tradition of keeping family close.His parents help look after their daughter, while in turn Mr Dong and his wife help take care of the parents.Mr Dong said there were always slight differences in habits and etiquette.""I keep telling my parents, don't hang their clothes in the garage door which you can see directly from the street, it's sort of the Australian way [not to do this],"" he said.""But I wouldn't say that Chinese people don't want to fit in, [some] just don't know the Australian way."" As Australia's migrant population continues to grow, the issue of racism remains a prominent one.Seventy-seven per cent of respondents to the Australia Talks National Survey said they thought there was still a lot of racism in Australia.Lily Yan said she had experienced racism, but for the most part she found Australia very friendly and welcoming.""I used to have an old car, it broke down all the time and I always had people approach me to help me,"" she said.She said her experiences could vary depending on where she was in the country.""I remember one of the first times stepping in the local pub, a very small pub in a small country town, and literally everyone just stopped,"" Ms Yan said with a smile.""They were all busy chatting and the moment I opened the door and walked in people just stopped. But they were really friendly to me.""Despite the occasional odd looks, she said from the moment she arrived in Australia she has felt comfortable.And these days she said she can't get enough of that sport synonymous with the Australian summer.""Now I do love barbecues and I do love cricket. In fact, I found very few of my local friends actually enjoy cricket as much as I do!""The Australia Talks National Survey asked 54,000 Australians about their lives and what keeps them up at night.

Concerns for welfare of Thai royal consort swirl after demotion,"October 25, 2019 16:24:29",Asia Pacific,"A prominent critic of the Thai monarchy has voiced concerns for the wellbeing of the recently demoted royal consort, who was described in a palace statement this week as ""scheming"" and ""ungrateful"". Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi was appointed as the King's official consort in July, the first such appointment in a century.Just three months later, her demotion was announced in the royal gazette, in unusually descriptive terms. ""She is also not content with the title bestowed upon her, doing everything to rise to the level of the queen,"" the official palace statement said.Ms Sineenat has not been seen publicly since then. One of the few Thai academics who openly criticises the monarchy is Pavin Chachavalpongpun, who is currently in Australia on a fellowship.""We can only guess what happened to Goy, perhaps maybe from looking back into the past, what happened to the two wives before Goy,"" said Mr Pavin, using the former royal consort's nickname.Mr Pavin told the ABC the King's second wife fled to the United States, with the couple's four sons, who were subsequently disowned.The King's third marriage also ended, but there is little official information about her whereabouts.""I know for sure that she has been placed under house arrest but what exactly caused her house arrest [has] never been told,"" Mr Pavin said.The ABC was not able to independently verify those allegations.""Judging from these two cases, I think Goy might follow in the same footsteps,"" he said.On Wednesday, another statement announced the dismissal of six palace staff, including a ""a nurse at the bedroom guard service"" and a veterinarian.""They have severely breached disciplinary conduct for their evil actions by exploiting their official positions for their own or other people's gain,"" the royal gazette said. Discussion of royal matters is severely restricted within Thailand, due to the aggressive use of lese majeste, computer crimes legislation and other laws.Breaking those rules can be risky.Mr Pavin is still shaken by an attack at his home-in-exile in Japan, where he is an associate professor at Kyoto University. In July, a man broke into his bedroom at 4:45am, pulled off the bedsheets and sprayed Mr Pavin and his partner with a substance believed to be capsicum spray.The assailant fled and nothing was stolen.Mr Pavin believes the attack was a message from someone in Thailand, an attempt to intimidate the outspoken academic into silence.Japanese police have not notified him of any progress in the case.There has been a string of brazen attacks, disappearances, arrests and murders of high-profile critics of the Thai monarchy and military-led Government.The bodies of two Thai men who disappeared from Laos were found in December in the Mekong River with their faces disfigured and their stomachs filled with concrete.The Thai Government has denied responsibility. The 2014 coup, led by current Prime Minister General Prayut Chan-o-cha, was widely seen as a way of stabilising Thailand ahead of a royal succession.King Maha Vajiralongkorn took the throne in 2016, after the death of his father King Bhumipol, who was widely revered by Thais as a father figure.King Vajiralongkorn — who studied at Sydney's King's College and at Duntroon military academy — is yet to gain the same popularity as his father. He spends much of his time in Germany but has made several decisive changes, taking direct control of the Crown Property Bureau and two key military units near Bangkok.Mr Pavin said the public demotion of the royal consort was part of the King's consolidation of power.""By demoting Goy, by punishing her in this way, I think it's part of him trying to express his absolute power to the public,"" he said.That's a theory shared by Tamara Loos, professor of history and Thai studies at Cornell University.""The demotion of Thailand's Royal Noble Consort Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi by King Vajiralongkorn is part of a larger phenomenon: we are witnessing the rise of a modern absolute monarchy in Thailand,"" Professor Loos said.""This seemingly personal event is profoundly political.""",concern welfare thai royal consort swirl demotion prominent critic thai monarchy ha voiced concern wellbeing recently demoted royal consort wa described palace statement week `` scheming '' `` ungrateful '' sineenat wongvajirapakdi wa appointed king official consort july first appointment century three month later demotion wa announced royal gazette unusually descriptive term `` also content title bestowed upon everything rise level queen `` official palace statement said sineenat ha seen publicly since one thai academic openly criticises monarchy pavin chachavalpongpun currently australia fellowship `` guess happened goy perhaps maybe looking back past happened two wife goy `` said mr pavin using former royal consort nickname mr pavin told abc king second wife fled united state couple four son subsequently disowned king third marriage also ended little official information whereabouts `` know sure ha placed house arrest exactly caused house arrest never told `` mr pavin said abc wa able independently verify allegation `` judging two case think goy might follow footstep `` said wednesday another statement announced dismissal six palace staff including `` nurse bedroom guard service '' veterinarian `` severely breached disciplinary conduct evil action exploiting official position people gain `` royal gazette said discussion royal matter severely restricted within thailand due aggressive use lese majeste computer crime legislation law breaking rule risky mr pavin still shaken attack home-in-exile japan associate professor kyoto university july man broke bedroom pulled bedsheets sprayed mr pavin partner substance believed capsicum spray assailant fled nothing wa stolen mr pavin belief attack wa message someone thailand attempt intimidate outspoken academic silence japanese police notified progress case ha string brazen attack disappearance arrest murder high-profile critic thai monarchy military-led government body two thai men disappeared lao found december mekong river face disfigured stomach filled concrete thai government ha denied responsibility coup led current prime minister general prayut chan-o-cha wa widely seen way stabilising thailand ahead royal succession king maha vajiralongkorn took throne death father king bhumipol wa widely revered thai father figure king vajiralongkorn studied sydney king college duntroon military academy yet gain popularity father spends much time germany ha made several decisive change taking direct control crown property bureau two key military unit near bangkok mr pavin said public demotion royal consort wa part king consolidation power `` demoting goy punishing way think part trying express absolute power public `` said theory shared tamara loo professor history thai study cornell university `` demotion thailand royal noble consort sineenat wongvajirapakdi king vajiralongkorn part larger phenomenon witnessing rise modern absolute monarchy thailand `` professor loo said `` seemingly personal event profoundly political `` ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-25/concerns-for-the-welfare-of-thai-royal-consort-after-demotion/11640666,2019-10-28,ABC News
Chinese-owned nickel plant in PNG shut down after toxic spill,"October 25, 2019 12:16:21",Asia Pacific,"Papua New Guinean authorities have shut down a Chinese-owned nickel processing plant for breaching safety and mining laws, after the operator spilled tens of thousands of litres of toxic slurry into a bay in August. PNG's Mineral Resources Authority (MRA) chose to take punitive action against the Ramu Nico plant, which is majority owned by the Metallurgical Corporation of China (MCC), after it failed to fix problems the authority identified while investigating the spill.These included incompetency among operators at the plant in PNG's Madang province, problems with the spillage containment system, and inadequate equipment maintenance.The authority said the processing facility would not be permitted to reopen until these issues were fixed — effectively halting all of Ramu Nico's mining operations for the time being.""They were given sixteen recommendations to rectify, and apparently six weeks down the line, we found that the operator has failed,"" MRA managing director Jerry Garry said. On August 24, a pump failure at the mine's Basamuk Bay processing plant saw about 200,000 litres of toxic slurry spill out, with up to 80,000 litres making its way into the ocean — turning the water bright red, and staining the nearby shoreline.While local officials have banned the sale of fish caught in the province following the spill, investigations into the resulting environmental damage have turned back markedly different results.One scientific report commissioned by the provincial government said there was evidence of widespread contamination, however PNG's environmental authority has said it found heavy metal contamination was within acceptable levels.A spokesman for the nickel mine's Chinese operator confirmed the shutdown order, and said the company was considering its legal options, Reuters reported.Ramu Nico has previously apologised for the slurry spill, but has denied it caused any serious environmental damage. While local villagers were happy to hear of the Ramu Nico closure, they told the ABC's Pacific Beat program they didn't think it went far enough, and called on the PNG Government to slap heavy penalties on the company.Louis Medaing, whose village is near the nickel processing plant, said the facility should have been closed straight after the spill, which some in the community have linked to health problems and fish kills. ""They didn't think of our lives, the Government has now realised and ordered the mine to be closed,"" he said.""That refinery must not open until everything is sorted out, everything is settled.""The temporary closure is the latest in a string of controversies for the $2 billion Ramu Nico mining operation, which was China's first major resource project in Papua New Guinea when it opened in 2012.Landowners had fought a legal battle to prevent the mine from disposing of its tailings in the ocean via a deep-sea pipeline, however this failed in the courts in 2010.Plaintiffs in the case chose to fire their lawyer and abandon proceedings, a decision National Court Justice David Cannings said was ""to a degree, suspicious"".He said ""reasonable people"" would question whether the plaintiffs had been intimidated, threatened or paid off.There have also been fights between local staff and Chinese workers in the past, as well as attacks on the facilities, earlier slurry leaks, and one fatal workplace accident in 2016 that saw the mine temporarily closed.",chinese-owned nickel plant png shut toxic spill papua new guinean authority shut chinese-owned nickel processing plant breaching safety mining law operator spilled ten thousand litre toxic slurry bay august png mineral resource authority mra chose take punitive action ramu nico plant majority owned metallurgical corporation china mcc failed fix problem authority identified investigating spill included incompetency among operator plant png madang province problem spillage containment system inadequate equipment maintenance authority said processing facility would permitted reopen issue fixed effectively halting ramu nico mining operation time `` given sixteen recommendation rectify apparently six week line found operator ha failed `` mra managing director jerry garry said august pump failure mine basamuk bay processing plant saw litre toxic slurry spill litre making way ocean turning water bright red staining nearby shoreline local official banned sale fish caught province following spill investigation resulting environmental damage turned back markedly different result one scientific report commissioned provincial government said wa evidence widespread contamination however png environmental authority ha said found heavy metal contamination wa within acceptable level spokesman nickel mine chinese operator confirmed shutdown order said company wa considering legal option reuters reported ramu nico ha previously apologised slurry spill ha denied caused serious environmental damage local villager happy hear ramu nico closure told abc pacific beat program think went far enough called png government slap heavy penalty company louis medaing whose village near nickel processing plant said facility closed straight spill community linked health problem fish kill `` think life government ha realised ordered mine closed `` said `` refinery must open everything sorted everything settled `` temporary closure latest string controversy $ billion ramu nico mining operation wa china first major resource project papua new guinea opened landowner fought legal battle prevent mine disposing tailing ocean via deep-sea pipeline however failed court plaintiff case chose fire lawyer abandon proceeding decision national court justice david cannings said wa `` degree suspicious '' said `` reasonable people '' would question whether plaintiff intimidated threatened paid also fight local staff chinese worker past well attack facility earlier slurry leak one fatal workplace accident saw mine temporarily closed ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-25/chinese-owned-nickel-plant-in-png-shut-down-after-toxic-spill/11636086,2019-10-28,ABC News
Thailand's King sacks officials over 'extremely evil' conduct,"October 24, 2019 10:53:46",Asia Pacific,"Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn has dismissed six palace officials for ""extremely evil"" conduct, in a shake-up that has come days after the sacking of the King's royal consort over ""disloyalty"". The six officials included a woman, a senior police official and two royal guards, all of whom worked in the palace, an announcement said. Two separate announcements published in the official royal gazette accused the six of severe disciplinary misconduct that caused harm to the royal service, and said they had been fired and stripped of all their official ranks.""The king has ordered their dismissal from royal service … because of their severe disciplinary misconduct and deeds that are considered extremely evil,"" one of the announcements said.The Royal Gazette said ""They [officials] have severely breached disciplinary conduct for their evil actions by exploiting their official positions for their own or other people's gain"", according to the BBC.This comes after former royal consort Sineenat Wongvajirapakdi was stripped of her titles in an extraordinary announcement on Monday, just months after the King made her his royal noble consort — the first such appointment in almost a century. A palace statement accused her of being ""disloyal"" and conducting a rivalry with Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana, who married King Vajiralongkorn in May just days before his elaborate coronation.Sineenat's whereabouts since her dismissal are not known.The official palace statement did not directly link the six sacked officials to Sineenat's dismissal.Since taking the throne following the death of his father King Bhumibol Adulyadej in 2016, Vajiralongkorn has proved to be an assertive constitutional monarch.He has been taking more direct control of royal affairs and the crown's vast wealth and transferred two military units from the Royal Thai Army to his personal control.Public criticism of the king or the royal family is illegal under Thailand's strict lese majeste laws, with insults to the monarchy punishable by up to 15 years in prison.Reuters",thailand king sack official extremely evil conduct thailand king maha vajiralongkorn ha dismissed six palace official `` extremely evil '' conduct shake-up ha come day sacking king royal consort `` disloyalty '' six official included woman senior police official two royal guard worked palace announcement said two separate announcement published official royal gazette accused six severe disciplinary misconduct caused harm royal service said fired stripped official rank `` king ha ordered dismissal royal service … severe disciplinary misconduct deed considered extremely evil `` one announcement said royal gazette said `` severely breached disciplinary conduct evil action exploiting official position people gain '' according bbc come former royal consort sineenat wongvajirapakdi wa stripped title extraordinary announcement monday month king made royal noble consort first appointment almost century palace statement accused `` disloyal '' conducting rivalry queen suthida bajrasudhabimalalakshana married king vajiralongkorn may day elaborate coronation sineenat whereabouts since dismissal known official palace statement directly link six sacked official sineenat dismissal since taking throne following death father king bhumibol adulyadej vajiralongkorn ha proved assertive constitutional monarch ha taking direct control royal affair crown vast wealth transferred two military unit royal thai army personal control public criticism king royal family illegal thailand strict lese majeste law insult monarchy punishable year prison reuters ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-24/thai-king-sacks-six-officials-further-royal-household-shake-up/11634460,2019-10-28,ABC News
Business lobby groups accused of 'undermining' climate change policy,"October 28, 2019 16:08:04",Business,"Macquarie Group co-founder, and now chairman of Alinta Energy, Mark Johnson is a pillar of the establishment.So it's surprising to hear he's no fan of business lobby groups like the Business Council of Australia (BCA) or the Minerals Council of Australia, which also see themselves as part of the establishment.Both are under pressure over their stance on climate change.""I suspect that it may be more analogous to our political situation where a relatively small rump of non-believers, conspiracy theorists and others have exerted influence to stop more proactive policies,"" Mr Johnson told the ABC.""You often want to stay outside associations or industry bodies which have a tendency to come up with a slightly lower common denominator answer."" And on climate change, there are many who believe that's exactly what business lobby groups are doing.The latest to speak out are big global investors with $16 trillion in shareholdings, who have put their name to a letter demanding action.""Investors have clear expectations of companies in impacted sectors and they're looking to work with them to get real positive progress in order to protect shareholder value,"" said Emma Herd, the CEO of Investor Group on Climate Change (IGCC), whose members are also signatories to that letter.One of the key demands is for their companies to withdraw from organisations that are not pulling their weight.""Investors expect companies to ensure that they are aligned with the Paris Agreement and that company resources are not used to support trade associations that act for short-term gain, undermining Paris Agreement objectives,"" the IGCC letter said.Front and centre is the coal lobby; groups like the Minerals Council of Australia, Coal 21 and the New South Wales Minerals Council, which the big institutions say, ""continue to undermine effective climate policy"".""I think there's a lot of scope for Australia's industry associations to be working better with their members, in terms of managing for what we know will be very real financial implications arising from climate change,"" Ms Herd said.The Business Council is under fire for supporting Kyoto carry-over credits to meet Australia's emissions reduction target for the more recent Paris Agreement.That's despite the BCA saying it supports Paris. ""In carbon accounting terms, that means that these organisations, and now the Federal Government, are planning for Australia to emit an additional 370 million tonnes of carbon, or CO2 equivalent, by 2030,"" Brynn O'Brien, head of shareholder activist group The Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), said.According to the BCA's website, its policy on climate change comes from its Energy and Climate Change Committee.A committee where the majority of member companies are heavy emitters of carbon.It includes big names like Origin Energy, Orica, Santos, BP, Ausgrid, Chevron, BHP, Caltex, Shell and ExxonMobil.""When you do have that key policy committee dominated by some of the companies that stand to benefit from delay to our de-carbonisation and our transition in Australia, that's how you end up with policy that is not representative of the broader membership,"" Ms O'Brien said.Under pressure from shareholders, Westpac, Telstra and BHP are among those reviewing their memberships of the Business Council.BHP is also reviewing its membership of the Minerals Council, having already quit the world Coal Association.""Many coal producers I think are quite realistic about the outlook for their commodity, they know that's it's going to decline,"" Mr Johnson said.""But they've got positions to preserve at the moment so they will work quite vociferously to preserve those positions."" Other lobby groups are also in the firing line.London-based shareholder activist group Influence Map has rated the world's worst on climate change.Four Australian organisations make the top 30, with the Minerals Council at number eight. The Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association (APPEA) is ranked 18th, while the Business Council is 20th and the Australian Industry Group is in 30th place. The top six lobby groups — in terms of resistance to climate change — are all from the United States, according to Influence Map.It has some harsh words for the Minerals Council though, slamming it as ""highly climate-oppositional"" and having a ""significant impact in undermining climate action"".As shareholder activists toughen their approach to lobby groups, the upcoming annual general meetings of BHP, ANZ and NAB will vote on resolutions calling for those companies to pull out of the Business Council. And as pressure has built on the Business Council, just to add to its woes, six big companies have cancelled their memberships — AMP, Santos, JB Hi Fi, QBE, Medibank Private and IAG.",business lobby group accused undermining climate change policy macquarie group co-founder chairman alinta energy mark johnson pillar establishment surprising hear fan business lobby group like business council australia bca mineral council australia also see part establishment pressure stance climate change `` suspect may analogous political situation relatively small rump non-believers conspiracy theorist others exerted influence stop proactive policy `` mr johnson told abc `` often want stay outside association industry body tendency come slightly lower common denominator answer `` climate change many believe exactly business lobby group latest speak big global investor $ trillion shareholding put name letter demanding action `` investor clear expectation company impacted sector looking work get real positive progress order protect shareholder value `` said emma herd ceo investor group climate change igcc whose member also signatory letter one key demand company withdraw organisation pulling weight `` investor expect company ensure aligned paris agreement company resource used support trade association act short-term gain undermining paris agreement objective `` igcc letter said front centre coal lobby group like mineral council australia coal new south wale mineral council big institution say `` continue undermine effective climate policy '' `` think lot scope australia industry association working better member term managing know real financial implication arising climate change `` herd said business council fire supporting kyoto carry-over credit meet australia emission reduction target recent paris agreement despite bca saying support paris `` carbon accounting term mean organisation federal government planning australia emit additional million tonne carbon co equivalent `` brynn brien head shareholder activist group australasian centre corporate responsibility accr said according bca website policy climate change come energy climate change committee committee majority member company heavy emitter carbon includes big name like origin energy orica santos bp ausgrid chevron bhp caltex shell exxonmobil `` key policy committee dominated company stand benefit delay de-carbonisation transition australia end policy representative broader membership `` brien said pressure shareholder westpac telstra bhp among reviewing membership business council bhp also reviewing membership mineral council already quit world coal association `` many coal producer think quite realistic outlook commodity know going decline `` mr johnson said `` got position preserve moment work quite vociferously preserve position `` lobby group also firing line london-based shareholder activist group influence map ha rated world worst climate change four australian organisation make top mineral council number eight australian petroleum production exploration association appea ranked th business council th australian industry group th place top six lobby group term resistance climate change united state according influence map ha harsh word mineral council though slamming `` highly climate-oppositional '' `` significant impact undermining climate action '' shareholder activist toughen approach lobby group upcoming annual general meeting bhp anz nab vote resolution calling company pull business council pressure ha built business council add woe six big company cancelled membership amp santos jb hi fi qbe medibank private iag ,https://www.abc.net.au//news/2019-10-28/business-lobby-groups-accused-undermining-climate-change/11646120?section=business,2019-10-28,ABC News
"Boom, doom and gloom: The forces uniting Australia and the United States","October 28, 2019 06:18:43",Business,"Why the long faces, everyone?For years, Australian consumers have been twitchy. With good reason. A lethal combination of soaring household debt, overpriced real estate and painfully weak wages have seen households slam the brakes on spending.Now, the pessimism is spreading to the business world and to financial markets.A survey of corporate leaders last week — almost 1,500 company directors — found that almost 60 per cent were concerned the economy would deteriorate next year, citing a laundry list of problems that primarily focused on things outside our control. China, trade wars and weak global conditions. Few, it appears, are convinced by the Reserve Bank's recent soothing remarks that we've entered a gentle upswing. In fact, just 8 per cent reckon things will be better next year.After decades of growth driven by a resources boom, a housing boom, an immigration boom and a construction boom, it would appear we are running out of options to maintain economic momentum.It's not just here, either.The mood of American business executives suddenly has turned sour. After two years of celebrating the rise of Donald Trump — whose corporate tax cuts added a burst of nitro to an already overrevved Wall Street — they too are anxious about the future. A study late last week showed confidence among American chief executives has dropped to its lowest level in a decade. That's despite a constant succession of Wall Street highs. For two years, corporate America has pumped up company valuations — and hence executive bonuses — through buying back shares, essentially showering investors in cash. It's been financed with the tax cuts and cheap debt.And that's the problem. Very little of the cash was invested for the future.The sugar hit from the tax cuts now has evaporated and with overstretched balance sheets, there's rising apprehension about borrowing more to simply hand back to investors, even with falling interest rates.Not surprisingly, the share buybacks suddenly have started to fall, raising concerns that one of Wall Street's key pillars has begun to crumble.In the second quarter, American companies spent $US166 billion ($243 billion) soaking up their own shares. That's well below the previous quarter's $US205 billion and the $US190 billion they spent in the same period last year. If it continues to drop, a large slab of demand for shares will be removed. No wonder the horses are jittery.Despite all the reassurances that the economy is in recovery, and RBA governor Philip Lowe's incantations that we're about to return to normal conditions next year, bond markets — the financial markets that really matter — simply don't believe it.Given his recent bullish comments to an IMF meeting in Washington, most pundits have scaled back the odds of a November rate cut. But there is a substantial bet on a pre-Christmas cut and almost certainty of one early in the New Year.In a weird contradiction, even senior RBA officials have hinted at just how they might continue propping things up once they exhaust their options on interest rates.If things really get desperate, with say a banking crisis, and the RBA cuts to 0.25 per cent, it seems likely the RBA's first step will be to inject money directly into the economy through what's known as Open Market Operations. This would help narrow the gap between the cash rate and the rate banks charge mortgage holders.It did this during the financial crisis in 2008 but interest rates were much higher back then. This time around, mortgage repayments could drop to around 1 per cent or even lower.US bond markets are behaving in a similar fashion. Late last year, American bond yields were rising in anticipation of a return to more normal economic conditions.The Trump administration's trade war put paid to all that. While US employment is still strong — as is the case here — the ongoing trade hostilities with China are starting to exact a toll in terms of manufacturing output and earnings. There's an unmistakable air of nervousness on stock markets. While the market sits just below record levels, three major local companies have been forced to back out of a stock market debut at the 11th hour in the past few weeks. First it was Latitude Finance, the former GE Money that enlisted the services of Ahmed Fahour in a bid to convince investors to tip in their hard-earned. Then came Retail Zoo, the owner of Boost Juice. And last Thursday, Singapore based Property Guru pulled its $362 million float. In each case investors baulked at the valuations. Latitude, which at $1 billion was to have been the richest float of the year, simply wasn't worth the price tag. Neither were the others. That followed a string of failures on Wall Street, the most spectacular being WeWork. From one of the most anticipated floats just a few months ago and worth a supposed $US100 billion, it now is in crisis, with founder Adam Neumann sacked and its high-profile Japanese backer SoftBank desperately attempting to keep it afloat. Uber and Lyft are trading at huge discounts to their listing price and investors, it would appear, have had enough.These developments have sent shockwaves through the venture capital and private equity industries and could be making some superannuation fund managers squirm.  With interest rates so low, super funds desperately have been seeking higher returns with many opting for ""alternative investments"". It's been a strategy that has delivered handsome returns. Until now. Venture capitalists, firms that inject cash into start ups, have been hyping the value of their investments, repeatedly marking them up each time they invest more cash despite many of them still burning cash. Private equity firms, meanwhile, have paid over the odds for old fixer-uppers, hoping a lick of paint and some new carpet may be enough to paper over the enormous debts and poor prospects when the flick them off to stock market investors. So, what do you do with your cash in a low-interest world if everything is overpriced?If there's one area where Australians are showing no signs of restraint, it is in real estate.  The three rate cuts since June have done little to ignite the real economy. Instead, after almost two years of declines, property prices are bouncing back with a vengeance, at least on the east coast. According to CoreLogic, the past weekend saw the busiest week for auctions this year, with clearance rates climbing to a national average of more than 75 per cent. This time last year, just 48 per cent of dwellings cleared at auction. With pressure on regulators to ease the credit restrictions imposed in the wake of the banking royal commission, it would appear the Federal Government and the Reserve Bank are keen for anything to boost sentiment and lift spirits, even if it is a return to the boom that caused the household debt problem in the first place.What could possibly go wrong?

'I don't know where I'm going to get the money': Interest-only borrowers facing difficult reset,"October 28, 2019 06:22:10",Business,"When Laura Christopher bought her house in Ipswich, Queensland, she signed up for an interest-only period. ""The fact the repayments were going to be a bit lower was the major drawcard,"" she told 7.30.""But I didn't quite understand the implications.""The reason repayments were originally lower is that during an interest-only period, borrowers are not paying off the debt they owe to the lender.When the term ends — or resets, as it is called in the industry — a borrower will start paying off both principal and interest unless they can secure an additional interest-only period.And for those who can not negotiate another interest-only loan, it has the potential to increase their repayments by thousands of dollars a year. During the most recent property boom, mortgages on interest-only terms became extraordinarily popular in Australia, at their peak accounting for nearly 40 per cent of the market.The financial regulators realised there was a risk some borrowers signing up to interest-only periods might struggle when they had to start paying back the principal.According to the Reserve Bank of Australia, the move from an interest-only period to principal and interest repayments costs borrowers, on average, an extra 30 to 40 per cent.If people are unable to afford the jump, they could be forced into default or into selling a property.A lot of people doing that at the same time could lead to large falls in the property market.So, the regulators forced the banks to massively curb how many interest-only terms they were offering.But the RBA also warned last year that, given the huge number of interest-only loans already agreed to, there were nearly half a trillion dollars of loans resetting over four years and with the new tighter rules on interest-only terms, a lot of those borrowers would not be able to extend the interest-only period. In Ms Christopher's case, the interest-only period came to an end in 2016 and her bank did not want to extend the term.Now paying off the principal as well, she saw her repayments jump by nearly $5,000 a year.""It causes me a great deal of stress and anxiety,"" she said.""I do manage to keep it to myself fairly well but there's still always that fear that if something big was to happen, I don't know where I'm going to get the money from to try and keep things going.""For people who are faced with a steep increase in repayments they can not afford, one option is to attempt to offload the property to pay down the debt.But Ms Christopher could not get the price she wanted.""When I tried to sell the house, the way the agent had marketed it was that it was an investor liquidating an asset, which bought out all the tyre-kickers who came in with ridiculous lowball offers,"" she said.""The offers were even less than what I had bought the house for seven years ago.""Ms Christopher is holding on but she is still struggling with the repayments, even after three interest rate cuts by the Reserve Bank this year. Retired police officers Peter and Bronwyn Dwight built up a large property portfolio to fund their retirement.""After I got interested in property investing, I read so many books on the matter and I decided to create a goal to make a goal for 30 properties,"" Mr Dwight told 7.30.""I think we got up to 16 income-producing properties and that meant we didn't quite reach our goal.""But, hey, we set a goal for Mars and we landed on the moon.""Most of their properties are currently in interest-only periods.""We went with interest-only mortgages because they provide a cash flow, you're not paying off the loan, as such,"" Mr Dwight said.They took out a 30-year loan with the Commonwealth Bank on one of their properties.For the first 15 years, they only paid interest on the loan — with three separate five-year interest-only periods.When the most recent interest-only period reset this year though, the bank would not give them another interest-only period.So they faced having to repay the principal in just 15 years.""If it was going to revert to the principal and interest on the current interest rate that they had, the payments would have gone from about the $2,000 per month up to close to $7,000 a month,"" Ms Dwight said.""Which just wouldn't have been financially viable for us to maintain, it would have forced us into having to consider selling a property before we were ready to do so.""After over ""14 or 15 applications"" to different banks, the Dwights were able to finally secure another interest-only term. But the Dwights are not out of the woods yet.They have many other interest-only loans due to convert to principal and interest over the next few years.""We've got five lenders and eight loans,"" Mr Dwight said.""So in the next this year, for instance, there's two more to go.""And then over the next three to four years, they'll begin to come out progressively."" Ms Dwight warned others not to get caught unaware.""I would suggest that there are a lot of people who are facing the same difficulties that Peter and I have just been facing and continue to face,"" she said.""If they're not thinking about it, and they're not preparing themselves, and they're not working it through, they're going to find themselves really struggling.""Despite their difficulties this year, Mr Dwight remained confident that property was the right option for their nest egg.""I think the demand for housing is still very, very strong,"" he said.But he is still keeping a close eye on how the interest-only transition plays out.""With people coming out of interest-only loans all in one hit, I don't know what will happen,"" he said.""I suppose that we will just ride that through when it happens."" So far, the concerns about the glut of interest-only terms ending at the same time have not caused a surge of loan defaults or investors fire-selling their properties, according to economist Saul Eslake.Interest rate cuts appear to have helped turn around the market and banks are once again loosening their lending standards with the threat of the royal commission now behind them.But Mr Eslake warns that people should not ignore the risks.""It could be that the people for whom the transition is going to be most difficult is the cohort that is yet to make the transition, whereas those who could do it comfortably did it sooner rather than later,"" he told 7.30.""Indeed, some of the Reserve Bank work suggests that a number of people have transitioned ahead of the legal requirement to do so.""So we'll have to wait and see how difficult it is for the remainder.""",know going get money interest-only borrower facing difficult reset laura christopher bought house ipswich queensland signed

Office workers are using ice baths to manage stress but health experts say the jury is still out,"October 27, 2019 09:05:20",Business,"Health practitioners are using ice baths to help busy professionals manage stress.  The technique has long been used by elite athletes for recovery, but now the breathing techniques are being taught to accountants and office workers to help them manage workplace and life stresses.Ben Murphy has developed a program teaching people to tackle the stress of an ice bath by harnessing what he calls ""the conscious breath"".""People hop in and they breathe shallow and sharp, really high up into the chest,"" he said.""What we teach people and share with people is to use the ice bath as a trigger, to hop in and breathe calmly and fully to take control of other stressful environments.""The program mirrors a similar technique developed by Dutch athlete Wim Hof, known as the ""Iceman"", who currently holds dozens of world records for extreme challenges in the cold. The 60-year-old runs workshops worldwide educating people on the breathing techniques he uses to calm his body and mind.Dr Llion Roberts from Queensland's Griffith University has closely investigated the effects of ice baths and said the immersion can put the body in a severe state of shock. ""The breathing techniques and the breathing type of training ... is really about trying to overcome and do the opposite of what the body's trying to get them to do,"" he said. Mr Murphy said many young Australians did not realise the impact breathing had on their hormones and stress levels.""Mainly people that are close to burnout, they're completely stressed, they're anxious, they have fear, they have sadness.""These are emotions that are attached to short and shallow breathing,"" he said.""We share with them tools that they can take back into their everyday life to start to manage these.""Accountant and entrepreneur Harvee Pene uses the breathing techniques to manage the pressure of owning and operating his small business.The father-of-two said it even helped him when he was blind-sided by a cancer diagnosis two years ago.""Business is around having a clear mind and making smart financial decisions,"" he said. ""For me, the breath was a little metaphor of one thing that I can control during a really turbulent time in my life where everything seemed to be out of control.""When I could control my breath, I realised that there were other things that I could look after such as my water or my movement or my exercise or my relationships,"" Mr Pene said.Mr Murphy said his clients also felt a sense of achievement after conquering five minutes in the ice bath.He said so far every client had lasted the entire time frame.""People feel fully-alive, fully-energised, immense vitality and they feel like they can basically tackle anything,"" he said.""We're trying to get our clients to fully breathe in, fully breathe oxygen in, fully breathe life into their body so they can then manage the hormones and the stress levels.""However, Dr Roberts said there was a lack of evidence to show ice baths was the most effective method of challenging the body's stress response. ""There is some research out there to show that people are able to get accustomed to this stressful exposure and this challenge.""Potentially there are other ways of achieving a similar outcome,"" he said.Dr Vince Kelly from Queensland University of Technology studied fatigue and recovery in athletes and said while the research into the physical benefits of ice baths has been scrutinised, their impacts on mental and mindset training was not yet thoroughly researched. ""They become difficult to sit in, it's not very comfortable and one of the responses that you might get from that is a stress response,"" he said.While these breathing workshops fill baths with more than 100 kilograms of ice, research shows athletes should instead focus on the duration of time spent in the bath, as opposed to the temperature.""Get a total of 10 minutes immersion in the water, so that can be one lot of 10 minutes, two lots of five minutes, it might be five lots of two minutes and then the recommendation around temperature is somewhere between 10 and 15 degrees Celsius,"" Dr Kelly said.A joint study by the University of Queensland and the Queensland University of Technology in 2015 showed that ice baths directly after strength training, could decrease an athlete's ability to build muscle.The research found that ice baths could dampen the natural responses of the body for athletes, if practiced too regularly.
